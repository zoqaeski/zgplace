There was once a herd of cows who lived inside an old wooden fence. One young cow always walked along the fence and dreamed of what it would be like to live outside the fence. She spoke to some of the other cows and they did not agree; they were happy in the fence, and the fence was all they knew. But she wanted freedom and for weeks and weeks she wondered how to get past the old wooden fence.

Finally one day she found a weak spot in the fence and with some effort pushed it down. She trotted out into the green field and called to the other cows. But the other cows refused to come. It was safe inside the fence, and there they would stay. So the young cow went out to explore the world outside the fence. She had a grand time. She roamed here and there, ate the fresh grass, drank the clean water, and had a very good time. She roamed and roamed for months, and finally found a particularly nice place of meadow that she decided to stay in.

One day while roaming around the meadow, she found an odd object. It was long and extended as far as could be seen; it was grey and shiny and hard. It worried her, for it looked very much like the old wooden fence and she was very worried that maybe she had gone in a circle and ended up right where she started. But after examining it at length, the cow trotted off, happy after all, and did not worry about the strange item that surrounded her meadow. For she knew that fences were made of wood, not metal.
