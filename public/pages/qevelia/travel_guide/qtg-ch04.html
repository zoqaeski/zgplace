			<h1>Get Around</h1>
			<p>Qevelia is a smallish country, measuring about 500km east-west by 400km north-south. However, the distances between towns are fairly large, but getting around is fairly cheap.</p>
			<h2>By Plane</h2>
			<p>Flying is the fastest, and also most expensive ways of getting around Qevelia. Domestic flights operate between all major cities; most smaller towns lack an airport. Adverse weather for much of the year can make air transport fairly unreliable, and it is advisable to check out other methods of getting around in winter.</p>
			<p>That being said, the accommodation and comfort are excellent, and Qevelian Airways should be noted for serving real food on their aircraft.</p>
			<h2>By Train</h2>
			<p>By and large, trains are the quickest, easiest and most convenient way to get around Qevelia. <em>Qevelék Zéšovárva</em>, the national railway company, operates frequent trains to just about every town and city in the country. Most services originate from the provincial capitals, with up to four express trains on main lines per day, and numerous local services every other hour. Branch lines only receive all-stops trains, and there are usually three or four per day, timetabled to connect with the main line expresses.</p>
			<p>There are six types of train service: <em>Flyers</em>, <em>InterCity</em>, <em>NightStar</em>, <em>Mail</em>, <em>Regio</em> and <em>Nazukiva</em>. Fares depend on the type of service; for long distance trains they are calculated as distance times a surcharge for either express (InterCity) or super-express (Flyer). For <em>Nazukiva</em> (suburban trains), the networks are divided into zones; a flat fare applies for travel within one zone (usually about Ҩ120) and this is multiplied by the number of zones crossed. Note that all stations (with the exception of isolated halts in the middle of nowhere) have ticket barriers, and ticket collectors who roam the trains are paranoid about fare evasion (and have the power to issue spot fines of up to Ҩ20000).</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Flyers</dt>
				<dd>These are high-speed tilting trains. They only operate along the West Coast Main Line and the Great Eastern Line. Fares are quite high due to the inclusion of a double express surcharge, and seats must be booked in advance.</dd>
				<dt>InterCity</dt>
				<dd>These trains are the normal express trains. They operate along all main lines, radiating out from Kirua, Dešva and Tonema, and only stop at selected stations of major towns. There are two classes, Premium Class (which has access to wireless internet, table service in the dining car, and other similar amenities), and Standard Class (which is still very comfortable and equivalent to first class travel in most other countries). Seats should also be booked for IC trains (bookings are essential for Premium Class). As would be expected, there is a higher fee for Premium Class, although still cheaper than the Flyer fare.</dd>
				<dt>NightStar</dt>
				<dd>These are the night equivalent of Flyers, and operate along the same routes, with the addition of Dešva - Umuqi. There are two kinds of accommodation, roomettes and berths; roomettes have a single or double bed, private shower/toilet facilities, etc. Berths are single bunks with shared amenities at the ends of the car. Bookings are essential for both.</dd>
				<dt>Regio</dt>
				<dd>These are the all-stops trains that operate across the whole network to all towns and cities. There is only one class of travel.</dd>
				<dt>Mail Trains</dt>
				<dd>These trains are the fast railway post office trains, and usually have a handful of sleeping cars, although only berths are available. They operate along the same routes as IC trains, however are often slower with longer station dwell times.</dd>
				<dt class="em">Natazykva (City Train)</dt>
				<dd>These are the suburban trains. These operate on networks centred around the following cities: Kirua, Dešva, Tonema, Šopoita, Lekko, Yukaya and Loidela. Like Regio trains, there is only one class of travel.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>In addition to the national rail network, there are a number of shorter lines operated by semi-private concessions, similar in nature to the classic interurbans. They generally run from town to town, and fares are slightly more expensive than QZ Regio trains. There are few competing QZ-Interurban trains, and most operate along former QZ branch lines and integrate into the local city public transport.</p>
			<h2>By Bus</h2>
			<p>Buses make connections to all towns and cities that are not connected by rail. Often they are slower than the trains (especially the Flyers and IC trains), and fares are usually more expensive due to road tolls. In some regions, especially the mountains, views can be more interesting (as the trains spend a lot of the time in tunnels).</p>
			<h2>By Car</h2>
			<p>Public transport is available in all larger towns and cities, however for journeys to places not connected by rail the car is a viable alternative. Driving in Qevelia is very expensive, partly due to fuel prices and partly due to tolls on the motorways. Car rental in Qevelia is also quite expensive, with the average prices ranged at about Ҩ60 and upwards. If you opt to bring in your own car, it must be registered with the Qevelian Vehicle Office. Tourists who intend to drive need to apply for a temporary tourist license beforehand, and to be eligible for one you must have held a full driving license for your country of origin for at least three years, preferably with no motor related incidents to date.</p>
			<p>When driving in the countryside, be aware that road conditions vary quite considerably. All major roads are sealed and in very good condition; local connecting roads outside of urban areas tend to be unsealed and more prone to the weather. Note that <strong>headlights</strong> must be kept on at <em>all</em> times while driving, in and out of cities, whether it is dark or not. Drivers must also stay very alert, particularly during dawn and dusk, for wild animals. Collisions with <strong class="em">tyntóva</strong> (lethal) and <strong class="em">šebiva</strong> (survivable) are common countrywide. It is recommended to avoid driving in remote areas during these hours and the night. QZ's car carriers are a popular way of travelling overnight with a vehicle; a compartment for 1-4 people and vehicular transportation starts at Ҩ10000.</p>
			<p>Winter driving can be somewhat hazardous, especially for those unused to cold conditions. Winter tires are mandatory from day 330 to day 060; however the most dangerous weather occurs around the zero degree mark (C), when slippery but near-invisible <strong>black ice</strong> forms on roads. Qevelian cars come with a heater to keep the engine warm overnight, and most overnight parking spots have a power outlet to feed them.</p>
			<p>Also note that Qevelian traffic fines are based on your income, so be careful. There is a near zero-tolerance on drink driving (0.04% is considered drunk driving), so think twice before having that second beer if you are planning on driving. Random breath tests are common during long weekends and holiday seasons.</p>
			<h2>By Thumb</h2>
			<p>Hitchhiking is certainly possible although unusual in Qevelia; the sparse traffic and sometimes hostile weather conditions don't exactly encourage standing around waiting for cars. Drivers may expect a small tip (this is unusual in other situations), so keep some change handy.</p>
