			<h1>Buy</h1>
			<p>The currency used in Qevelia is the <em>Qiropól (Ҩ)</em>. It is fixed at AU$1.44 per Ҩ100. There are the following denominations: (notes) Ҩ20000, Ҩ10000, Ҩ5000 &amp; Ҩ1000; (coins) Ҩ500, Ҩ200, Ҩ100, Ҩ50, Ҩ20, Ҩ10, Ҩ5, Ҩ2 &amp; Ҩ1. Getting and exchanging money is seldom a problem, as all towns have at least one ATM, and banks in most larger towns and cities will exchange money (although for a fee, usually about 2.4%).</p>
			<h2>Costs</h2>
			<p>Qevelia is about average as far as prices go. There is no sales tax, such as a GST, however prices really depend on the type of item. Government regulations in a lot of fields means that prices for similar items are usually similar, and obviously you will pay a higher price for higher-quality goods. Goods bought within Qevelia as (expensive) souvenirs or gifts may have an export tax attached when you leave the country; it is worth checking up on this with customs when you arrive. For this reason it is vital you keep dockets of purchases.</p>
