			<h1>Towns, Cities, and other destinations</h1>
			<p>The majority of Qeveli live in towns and cities, with few living between them. Thus the population is concentrated in areas of settlement separated by usually more than 20km. The exception to the rule is in the major urban areas surrounding the largest cities, Kirua being the prime example. Compared to terrestrial cities, these urban areas are far more densely populated and squeezed into a smaller area.</p>
			<h2>Major Cities</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Kirua</em> is the capital and largest city of Qevelia. It is located on the estuary of the Plåkea river.</li>
				<li><em>Dešva</em> is considered to be the second city of Qevelia. It is about 250km south of Kirua, and is a major international port.</li>
				<li><em>Tonema</em>, located at the northern tip of the <em>Rovål</em>, is the third largest city, and is considered to be the southern gateway to Qevelia.</li>
				<li><em>Lekko</em>, the capital of Aleha, is a major cultural centre and the historic capital of Qevelia.</li>
				<li><em>Šopoita</em> is the most northerly provincial capital, and was for many years part of Josseå. Even when Qevelia gained independence in 1269CE, Šopoita remained an autonomous outpost of Josseå, until it was peacefully given back to the Qeveli in 1407CE.</li>
				<li><em>Yukaya</em> is the capital of the mountainous regions, and as such is the highest provincial capital, situated between 700 and 1000 metres above mean sea level.</li>
				<li><em>Loidela</em> is the easternmost provincial capital, and is located on the edge of the <em>luiso</em> plains.</li>
				<li><em>Umuqi</em> is the capital of Moluira, and is the furthest from Kirua. It has many historic castles and was the fortress of the East.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Other Places of Interest</h2>
			<p>Asides from the major cities, there are numerous other places to go in Qevelia. Due to the relatively large distances between towns, there are large tracts of unspoilt natural beauty. </p>
			<ul>
				<li> The Oteqa mountains are quite scenic and fairly accessible, although it is recommended that one checks prevailing weather conditions before going off the beaten track. The land above 1500 metres is very isolated, and it is very easy to get lost on the highland moors; so before embarking too deep into the ranges you should inform the park rangers of your approximate location and expected return. A good map and GPS receiver with VFH/UHF radio are a must.</li>
				<li> The coastal regions are heavily forested and also quite rugged in places, especially on the short stretch between Pelya and Tenka. Lautou Zemya, an island near Latunya, is another scenic hotspot and is accessible via a twice daily ferry from Latunya. Note that motor vehicles are not allowed on the island, and cannot be transported across. </li>
				<li>During the summer months the beaches in the south are very popular among the Qeveli people, and most places to stay will be booked out a month in advance, so book in early if you plan to go there.</li>
				<li> Vika-Huiva National park is famous for its geysers and volcanic lakes.</li>
				<li> Most of Qevelia's wilderness areas are accessible by tracks through the forests, and there are plenty of well known mountain biking tracks. One of the best is the rail trail between Amatta and Vinso, that follows the old route over the Lošcia Pass.</li>
				<li> Most small towns have their own little quirky places to visit, and it is best to enquire at the local tourist information centres to find out more about these.</li>
