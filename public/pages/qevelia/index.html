			<h1>Qevelia</h1>
			<p>Qevelia is a country on the north western coast of Terala, and has borders with Sjenka, Muia and Josse√•. The country is modern and well planned with many small towns and larger cities, however there are still huge tracts of unspoilt natural landscapes. Despite being among the most technologically advanced countries in Terannia, most Qeveli love to go to the beaches on the coast during the warmer months, and playing the winter sports during the cold winter.</p>
			<p>These pages are about this country.</p>
