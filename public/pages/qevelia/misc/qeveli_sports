#1 ???
Field:
	The sport is played on a circular sector shaped field which has a radius of 8 cëmpai (approximately 205 metres) and an angle of about 15°. The inner 4 cëmpai of the field is a dead zone called the “???”; the outer 4 cëmpai is further divided into six landing zones (“???”), whose boundaries are marked out and numbered.
	The players on the defending team are positioned as follows:
		* Two players on each odd-numbered boundary located approximately 4° inside the outer edge of the playing field.
		* A single player in the centre of the second, fourth, and sixth boundaries.
		* Two more players on the seventh boundary roughly between the centre player on the sixth and the edge player on the seventh.


Equipment:
	Two symmetrical curved ramps
	A disc of about 12 cm in diameter and 4 cm thick (“Vúšši”)
	A striking whip
	Catcher nets

Play
	There are two teams of 13 players each. One team is positioned on the playing field as described above, whilst the other takes turns at striking the Vúšši. Each player of the striking team hits three Vúšši.
	The striker swings the whip and hits the Vúšši to send it into the field. Penalties are awarded for hits that do not clear the dead zone or go outside the playing field’s radial boundaries.
	The defending team must first spot the flying Vúšši, and then intercept it by attempting to catch it in their net.

Scoring
	The score is marked by the zone in which the Vúšši falls:
		Z1: 1 point
		Z2:	2 points
		Z3: 4 points
		Z4: 8 points
		Z5:	16 points
		Z6: 32 points
		Z7: 48 points
	If the catching team catches the Vúšši before it hits the ground, they score instead of the striking team.
	The winner is the team with the most points at the end of the game. If there is a tie, one compares the sums of the total strike lengths. The team with the greater sum wins.
