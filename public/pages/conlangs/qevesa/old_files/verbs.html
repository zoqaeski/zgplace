			<h1>Verbal Morphology</h1>
			<p>The verb is the most complex part of Qevesa, and the most important element of a sentence. Verbs are marked for topical agreement, aspect, mood and evidentiality; other constructions are marked periphrastically.</p>
			<!--<p>Finite verbs may seem to be incredibly complex, as they are marked for up to eight categories:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Dechticaetiative agreement</li>
				<li>Ergative agreement</li>
				<li>Accusative agreement</li>
				<li>Aspect</li>
				<li>Mood</li>
				<li>Polarity</li>
				<li>Evidentiality</li>
				<li>Telicity</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The first three categories consist of personal agreement with other arguments in the clause. Tense is not marked, but if required, will be indicated with adverbs for the specific time.</p>-->

			<h2>Structure of the Verb</h2>
			<p>Qevesa is a language based on triliteral roots; a large percentage of the lexicon is derived from a considerably smaller base set of consonant groups. The system is highly regular, with the only irregularities occurring with certain consonants, especially /h/ and /j/; these thus form verb declension classes. Due to the triliteral nature of the root, many grammatical categories are marked with transfixes, most of the others being marked with suffixes.</p>
			<p>The verb classes are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Class 1</strong> roots do not contain <em>-h-</em> or <em>-j-</em>, in any position. This is the largest group of triliteral roots.</li>
				<li><strong>Class 2</strong> roots are those which have <em>-h-</em> as the second consonant. This class also includes nearly all biliteral roots.</li>
				<li><strong>Class 3</strong> roots are  those which have <em>-h-</em> as the third consonant.</li>
				<li><strong>Class 4</strong> roots are those which have <em>-j-</em> as the second or third consonant.</li>
				<li><strong>Class 5</strong> verbs include all verbs whose roots have <em>h-</em> or <em>j-</em> as the initial consonant.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Aspect</h3>
			<p>Aspect is possibly the most important grammatical category marked on the verb. Instead of tense, aspect is used to mark the temporal flow (or lack thereof) of verbs. Qevesa distinguishes between imperfective aspects (those that are ongoing, habitual, repeated or generally containing internal structure) and perfective aspects (those that are viewed as a single whole). There are two primary transfix patterns, corresponding to the imperfective and perfective aspects, and a number of secondary transfix patterns which indicate various subtle (mainly semantic) differences.</p>

			<h4>The Imperfective Aspects</h4>
			<p>The imperfective aspects are used to indicate the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>progressive or durative actions (the <em>dynamic imperfective</em>);</li>
				<li>states and activities posing the background for other (perfective) activities (the <em>background imperfective</em>);</li>
				<li>habitual activities (the <em>habitual imperfective</em>);</li>
				<li>multiple (iterative) activities (the <em>iterative imperfective</em>);</li>
				<li>non-resultative activities or states (the <em>irresultative imperfective</em>); and</li>
				<li>continuous states (the <em>stative imperfective</em>).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are marked as follows:</p>

			<h4>The Perfective Aspects</h4>
			 <p>The perfective aspects generally indicate activities that have distinct beginnings and ends which are relevant to the speaker. This implies past or future activities, but not present activities – an activity which is happening now cannot be ended, so it cannot be perfective. The perfective indicates the following:</p>
			 <ul>
				<li>states and activities which were ended (even if a second ago) or which will be ended (the <em>simple perfective</em>);</li>
				<li>actions whose goals have already been achieved, especially those viewed from the perspective of a later time (the <em>retrospective</em>);</li>
				<li>the beginning of the activity or the state (the <em>inceptive</em>);</li>
				<li>the end of the activity or the state (the <em>terminative</em>); and</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are marked as follows:</p>

			<h3>Personal/Topical Agreement</h3>
			<p>Verbs are also marked for agreement with the noun phrase which is in the nominative case, as this marks the topic of the sentence. If the noun phrase in the nominative case is a pronoun, it may be omitted.</p>

			<h3>Mood</h3>
			<p>Qevesa indicates mood through suffixes on the verb, some of which cause changes in its final vowel. At least one mood is mandatory.</p>

			<h4>The Declarative Mood</h4>
			<p>The declarative mood is equivalent to the indicative mood, and indicates that the statement is true. It is formed by the addition of the suffix <em>-u</em>.</p>

			<h4>The Conditional Mood</h4>
			<p>The conditional mood is used to refer to an action or state that is dependent on a condition, and to refer to that condition. It is formed by the addition of the suffix <em>-iti</em>.

			<h4>The Intentive Mood</h4>
			<p>The intentive mood is used to indicate that the speaker intends to perform the action. It is formed by the addition of the suffix <em>-qi</em>.</p>

			<h4>The Optative Mood</h4>
			<p>The optative mood is used to indicate wishes and desires. It is formed by the suffix <em>-ši</em>.</p>

			<h4>The Prohibitive Mood</h4>
			<p>The prohibitive mood indicate that the action or state cannot occur. It is formed by the suffix <em>-me</em>.</p>

			<h4>The Imperative Mood</h4>
			<p>The imperative mood is used to indicate orders and commands. It is formed by the suffix <em>-ːl</em>; i.e. lengthening of the previous vowel and the addition of <em>-l</em>; long vowels are unmodified.</p>

			<h3>Evidentiality</h3>
			<p>The final mandatory part of the verb is the evidentiality suffix. There are four degrees of evidentiality:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Witness</dt>
				<dd>The speaker is a witness to the action or event, so possesses first-hand knowledge.</dd>
				<dt>Inferential</dt>
				<dd>The speaker infers based on other evidence, usually physical.</dd>
				<dt>Reportative</dt>
				<dd>Used for reported statements or hearsay.</dd>
				<dt>Assumption</dt>
				<dd>Used for assumptions without evidence.</dd>
			</dl>

			<!--<h3>Other Auxiliary Constructions</h3>
			<p>The auxiliary verb has a number of regular constructions that are used to convey additional information.</p>-->



			<h2>Verb prefixes and proclitics</h2>
			<p>There is a wide range of prefixes and proclitics which alter the meaning of a verb. Most of them are derivatives of other verbs or nouns, usually phonetic simplifications, although there are some which are independent lexemes. These can be grouped into several classes.</p>

			<h3>Polarity</h3>
			<p>Polarity is an unusual development of the negative form of verbs, in which the negation suffix detached from the auxiliary verb, possibly by analogy with the affirmative proclitic.</p>
			<table cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<th colspan="2" />
					<th>Prevocalic</th>

					<td>tó</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Negative</th>
					<th class="sc">neg</th>
					<td>m’</td>
					<td>mó</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<h3>The Causative</h3>
			<p>The causative is a special construction which takes its own arguments. It consists of the proclitic <em>pék</em>.</p>
		<!--
			<h3>Other prefixes</h3>
			<p>These describe the manner in which the verb is done, an associated action, or an associated object. The most common are listed below:</p>
			<table cellspacing="0">

			<!--<h2>Particles</h2>
			<p>There are a number of particles, normally enclitic, that may be used to indicate additional information. When there is more than one particle attached to a verb, they are fusionally conjoined.</p>
			<h3>Active Voice</h3>
			<p>Intrasitive verbs may be followed by the particle <em>le</em>, which basically states that the sole argument was in control of the action rather than being simply an experiencer.</p>
			<h3>Telicity</h3>
			<p>Telicity, or resultivity, can be indicated with the particle <em>kuo</em>.</p>
			<h3>Negation</h3>
			<p>Negation in Qevesa is achieved through use of the adverbial/prepositional particle <em>niširo</em> ("not"). Alternatively, negation may be indicated by the postpositonal particle <em>ně</em>.</p>-->
			<!--<ul>
				<li><em>A vukulkos sokóinusěr.</em> DEF article-ACC write-1SG.IPF "I wrote the article (and completed it; it was published)."</li>
				<li><em>A vukulkos sokóinusěr<strong>veš</strong>.</em> DEF article-ACC write-1SG.IPF-ATL "I wrote the article (but did not complete it)."</li>
				<li><em>A vukulkos sokóinukěr.</em> DEF article-ACC write-1SG.PFT "I have written the article (and completed it)."</li>
				<li><em>A vukulkos sokóinukěr<strong>veš</strong>.</em> DEF article-ACC write-1SG.PFT-ATL "I have written the article (completed)."</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The last example implies that the particular occurrence of the action has ended, although the final goal is yet to be achieved.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><em>Laikulusěrztu.</em> fish.PRG.V-1PL.IPF-PRG "We went fishing (and caught something)."</li>
				<li><em>Laikulusěrztu<strong>veš</strong>.</em> fish.PRG.V-1PL.IPF-PRG-ATL "We went fishing (but did not catch anything)."</li>
				<li><em>Laikulukěrztu.</em> fish.PRG.V-1PL.PFT-PRG "We have been fishing (and caught something)."</li>
				<li><em>Laikulukěrztu<strong>veš</strong>.</em> fish.PRG.V-1PL.PFT-PRG-ATL "We have been fishing (but did not catch anything)."</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Again, the last example indicates that the instance of the action had finished occurring, however its goal was not achieved.</p>-->
			<!--<p>As can be seen from the examples, the suffix for telicity is <em>-veš</em>.</p>-->

			<h2>Nominalisations</h2>
			<p>As Qevesa is based on triconsonantal roots, most nouns are formed from verb roots, and each root can produce a variety of nominal forms.</p>

			<h3>Concept</h3>
			<p class="strong">CeCeC</p>
			<p>This is a general nominalisation representing the concept, process, activity or ability.</p>

			<h3>Actor</h3>
			<p class="strong">CaCoiC</p>
			<p>A person that performs the action.</p>

			<h3>Patient</h3>
			<p class="strong">CoCCit</p>
			<p>Something that undergoes the action.</p>

			<!--
				nurture: n-t-m
				→ notmisiro: boy
				→ notmisisse: girl


			-->

			<h3>Resulting Object</h3>
			<p class="strong">CiCáC</p>
			<p>An object resulting from the action.</p>

			<h3>Art</h3>
			<p class="strong">CeCöCa</p>
			<p>Names an art, skill, or science.</p>

			<h3>Device</h3>
			<p class="strong">CeC~aC</p>
			<p>A non-human object that performs the action.</p>

			<h3>Instrument</h3>
			<p class="strong">CiuCíC</p>
			<p>A tool or object used to perform the action.</p>

			<h3>Location</h3>
			<p class="strong">aCCéC</p>
			<p>A place where the action is performed.</p>

			<h3>Ergative Participle</h3>
			<p class="strong">iCaCCa</p>
			<p>Something which acts.</p>

			<h3>Accusative Participle</h3>
			<p class="strong">öCyCeC</p>
			<p>Something which is acted upon.</p>

			<!--<p>Gender specific variants of the above nominalisations can be formed with the suffixes <em>-(i)ro</em> and <em>-(i)sse</em>.</p>-->

			<!--<h2>Compound Verbs</h2>
			<p>In addition to the basic verbs formed by the morphological processes described above, verbs can also be compounded to convey additional meaning. There are two primary methods of compounding: enclitics/suffixes that attach to the auxiliary verb; and proclitics/prefixes that attach to the primary verb. Enclitics on the auxiliary verb are normally used to indicate the manner in which the action is performed, and proclitics on the primary verb are normally used to indicate additional objects and the like. Both of these constructions are extremely productive, and in some (relatively rare) cases are used to create roots with four or more consonants.</p>-->
