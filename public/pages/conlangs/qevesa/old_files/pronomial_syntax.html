	<h1>Pronomial Syntax</h1>
	<h2>Personal Pronouns</h2>
	<p>Qevesa is a pro-drop language, as subject and object pronouns of the first and second person are usually omitted before the verb; by not doing so, the speaker gives the subject special emphasis. The same may also be done for third person, but this occurs much less frequently.</p>

	<h2>Reflexive and Reciprocal</h2>
	<p>The reflexive pronoun <em>vyň</em> is used for reflexive constructions <em>within a single clause</em>:</p>
