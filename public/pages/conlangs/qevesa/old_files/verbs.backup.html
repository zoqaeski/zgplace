			<div class="toc" id="qevesa"></div>
			<h1>Verbal Morphology</h1>
			<p>The verb is the most complex part of Qevesa, and the most important element of a sentence. Nearly all verbs have two parts, a stem that is marked for polypersonal agreement, and an auxiliary verb that is marked for aspect, mood and evidentiality.</p>
			<!--<p>Finite verbs may seem to be incredibly complex, as they are marked for up to eight categories:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Dechticaetiative agreement</li>
				<li>Ergative agreement</li>
				<li>Accusative agreement</li>
				<li>Aspect</li>
				<li>Mood</li>
				<li>Polarity</li>
				<li>Evidentiality</li>
				<li>Telicity</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The first three categories consist of personal agreement with other arguments in the clause. Tense is not marked, but if required, will be indicated with adverbs for the specific time.</p>-->

			<h2>The Verb Stem</h2>
			<p>The verb stem is usually non-finite (indeed, only a handful of irregular verbs have finite forms) and only marks polypersonal agreement with the subject and object(s). It normally consists of C1uC2C3u. Affixes are inserted into P0 (before C1), P23 (between C2 and C3) and replacing P4 (after C3) to indicate person; no other conjugations are marked directly on the verb stem (ignoring irregular verbs for the moment).</p>

			<h3>Morphosyntactic alignment</h3>
			<p>This section is detailed in <a href="index.html?page=conlangs/qevesa/syntax">syntax</a>, but to get an introduction to the verbal system of Qevesa it is briefly described here. Qevesa is a fluid-S language, whose primary morphological cases are outlined as follows:</p>
			<ul class="nb">
				<li>The <strong>S</strong>ubject of an involuntary (i.e. subject not in control) intransitive verb is marked with the same case as the <strong>T</strong>heme of a ditransitive verb.</li>
				<li>The <strong>S</strong>ubject of a voluntary (i.e. subject in control) intransitive verb is marked with the same case as the <strong>A</strong>gent of a transitive verb or <strong>D</strong>onor of a ditransitive verb.</li>
				<li>The <strong>P</strong>atient of a transitive verb is always marked with the same case as the <strong>R</strong>ecipient of a ditransitive verb.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These three primary cases are referred to as the <em>secundative case</em>, the <em>nominative case</em> and the <em>primative case</em>. Each of these primary cases forms a verb paradigm in the triconsonantal system.</p>

			<h3>The Three Verb Paradigms</h3>

			<h4>The Secundative Paradigm</h4>
			<p>This is only used with intransitive and ditransitive verbs, to indicate the involuntary subject and the theme. When used alone, the involuntary intransitive is implied; elsewhere the verb must be ditransitive. It is formed by the addition of a affix in P4. If not marked, P4 consists of the vowel <em>-u</em>.</p>

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th class="sc">3pl</th>
					<td>-ōv</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th class="sc">3;inanim</th>
					<td>-is</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<h4>The Nominative Paradigm</h4>
			<p>The nominative may be used with intransitive, (mono-)transitive and ditransitive verbs. When used alone, the voluntary intransitive is implied; combinining with other paradigms produces transitive and ditransitive verbs. It is formed by the insertion of an infix in P23, which replaces any other vowels there.</p>
			<table cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<th class="sc">1sg</th>
					<td>-e-</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th class="sc">2sg</th>
					<td>-a-</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th class="sc">3sg</th>

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th class="sc">1pl</th>
					<td>-ev-</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th class="sc">2pl</th>

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th class="sc">3pl</th>
					<td>-ōv-</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th class="sc">3;inanim</th>
					<td>-ī-</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<h4>The Primative Paradigm</h4><!-- write more below -->
			<p>Unlike the other two paradigms, the primative cannot be used alone, as it marks the patient or the recipient of a transitive or ditransitive verb. It is formed by the insertion of a prefix in P0.</p>
			<table cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<th class="sc">1sg</th>
					<td>ě-</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th class="sc">2sg</th>
					<td>jā-</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th class="sc">3sg</th>
					<td>ō-</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th class="sc">1pl</th>
					<td>ēv-</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th class="sc">2pl</th>
					<td>jav-</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th class="sc">3pl</th>
					<td>jov-</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th class="sc">3;inanim</th>
					<td>ī-</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<p>From the above tables, the following can be noted about all three paradigms:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The basic infixes are:<ul class="nb">
					<li><span class="sc">1sg</span>: <em>(-)e(-)</em></li>
					<li><span class="sc">2sg</span>: <em>(-)a(-)</em></li>
					<li><span class="sc">3sg</span>: <em>(-)ō(-)</em></li>
					<li><span class="sc">3;inanim</span>: <em>(-)is(-)</em></li>
				</ul></li>
				<li>The plural is indicated by a <em>-v-</em> that follows the person-marking vowel, however this never occurs for the inanimate third person.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>The Auxiliary Verb</h2>
			<p>The auxiliary verb is used to indicate everything else, and is mandatory in all but informal speech. Categories marked on the auxiliary include aspect, mood and evidentiality, and optionally voice, and polarity. Qevesa does not mark tense at all; if time needs to be indicated, an adverb will be used instead. The auxiliary verb agrees with its head (the stem verb) in transivity.</p>

			<h3>Aspect</h3>
			<p>Instead of tense, aspect is used to mark the temporal flow (or lack thereof) of verbs. Qevesa distinguishes between imperfective aspects (those that are ongoing, habitual, repeated or generally containing internal structure) and perfective aspects (those that are viewed as a single whole). Each of these uses a different auxiliary verb construction.</p>

			<h4>The Imperfective Aspects</h4>
			<p>The imperfective aspects are used to indicate the following:</p>
			<ul>
			    <li>progressive or durative actions (the <em>dynamic imperfective</em>);</li>
				<li>states and activities posing the background for other (perfective) activities (the <em>background imperfective</em>);</li>
				<li>simultaneous activities (the <em>simultaneous imperfective</em>);</li>
				<li>habitual activities (the <em>habitual imperfective</em>);</li>
				<li>multiple (iterative) activities (the <em>iterative imperfective</em>);</li>
				<li>non-resultative activities (the <em>irresultative imperfective</em>); and</li>
				<li>continuous states (the <em>stative imperfective</em>).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The imperfect auxiliary verb stem is <em>da</em>.</p>

			<p>From the table above, the following generalities can be observed:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>d-l-</strong> is intransitive;</li>
				<li><strong>d-s-</strong> is transitive;</li>
				<li><strong>d-c-</strong> is ditransitive;</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>The Perfective Aspects</h4>
			 <p>The perfective aspects generally indicate activities that have distinct beginnings and ends which are relevant to the speaker. This implies past or future activities, but not present activities – an activity which is happening now cannot be ended, so it cannot be perfective. The perfective indicates the following:</p>
			 <ul>
				<li>states and activities which were ended (even if a second ago) or which will be ended (the <em>simple perfective</em>);</li>
				<li>single-time activities (the <em>singulative</em>);</li>
				<li>actions whose goals have already been achieved, especially those viewed from the perspective of a later time (the <em>retrospective</em>);</li>
				<li>the beginning of the activity or the state (the <em>inceptive</em>);</li>
				<li>the end of the activity or the state (the <em>terminative</em>); and</li>
				<li>actions or states which last some time but have a definite end (the <em>durative perfective</em>).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The perfective auxiliary verb stem is <em>ko</em>.</p>

			<p>Again, the following generalities can be observed:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>k-t-</strong> is intransitive;</li>
				<li><strong>k-z-</strong> is transitive;</li>
				<li><strong>k-p-</strong> is ditransitive;</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Mood</h3>
			<p>Qevesa indicates mood through suffixes on the auxiliary verb, some of which cause changes in its final vowel. At least one mood is mandatory.</p>

			<h4>The Declarative Mood</h4>
			<p>The declarative mood is equivalent to the indicative mood, and indicates that the statement is true. It is formed by the addition of the suffix <em>-u</em>, although this is usually merged with the final vowel of the auxiliary verb as follows:</p>
			<table cellspacing="0"  id="decl_mood_vowel_changes">
				<tr>
					<td>a</td>
					<td rowspan="6">→</td>
					<td>au</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>i</td>
					<td>y</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>ī</td>
					<td>ȳ</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>o</td>
					<td>ō</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>u</td>
					<td>ū</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>y</td>
					<td>ȳ</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<h4>The Conditional Mood</h4>
			<p>The conditional mood is used to refer to an action or state that is dependent on a condition, and to refer to that condition. It is formed by the addition of the suffix <em>-iti</em>. The following auxiliary vowel changes occur:</p>
			<table cellspacing="0"  id="cond_mood_vowel_changes">
				<tr>
					<td>a</td>
					<td rowspan="6">→</td>
					<td>ai</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>i</td>
					<td>ī</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>ī</td>
					<td>ī</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>o</td>
					<td>oi</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>u</td>
					<td>ui</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>y</td>
					<td>ȳ</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<h4>The Intentive Mood</h4>
			<p>The intentive mood is used to indicate that the speaker intends to perform the action. It is formed by the addition of the suffix <em>-qi</em>.</p>

			<h4>The Optative Mood</h4>
			<p>The optative mood is used to indicate wishes and desires. It is formed by the suffix <em>-ši</em>.</p>

			<h4>The Prohibitive Mood</h4>
			<p>The prohibitive mood indicate that the action or state cannot occur. It is formed by the suffix <em>-me</em>.</p>

			<h4>The Imperative Mood</h4>
			<p>The imperative mood is used to indicate orders and commands. It is formed by the suffix <em>-ːl</em>; i.e. lengthening of the previous vowel and the addition of <em>-l</em>; long vowels are unmodified.</p>

			<h4>Summary</h4>
			<p>The following table summarises the mood suffixes:</p>
			<table cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<th colspan="3" />
					<th>Variants</th>
					<th />

				<tr>
					<th>Declarative</th>

				<tr>
					<th>Imperative</th>
					<th class="sc">impv</th>
					<td>-ːl</td>
					<td />
					<td class="tl">Lengthens auxiliary verb final vowel.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<h3>Evidentiality</h3>
			<p>The final mandatory part of the auxiliary verb is the evidentiality suffix. There are four degrees of evidentiality:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Witness</dt>
				<dd>The speaker is a witness to the action or event, so possesses first-hand knowledge.</dd>
				<dt>Inferential</dt>
				<dd>The speaker infers based on other evidence, usually physical.</dd>
				<dt>Reportative</dt>
				<dd>Used for reported statements or hearsay.</dd>
				<dt>Assumption</dt>
				<dd>Used for assumptions without evidence.</dd>
			</dl>
			<table cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<th>Witness</th>
					<th class="sc">ewts</th>
					<td>-m</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Inferential</th>
					<th class="sc">einf</th>
					<td>-k</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Reportative</th>
					<th class="sc">erpt</th>
					<td>-z</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Assumption</th>
					<th class="sc">easm</th>
					<td>-t</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<h3>Other Auxiliary Constructions</h3>
			<p>The auxiliary verb has a number of regular constructions that are used to convey additional information.</p>

			<h4>The Causative</h4>
			<p>The causative is in a class of its own, in that it is used so frequently that it is likely to become a regular suffix. Derived from <em>ispurōku kozym</em> (s/he causes it), it consists of the enclitic <em>poik</em>.</p>

			<h4>Polarity</h4>
			<p>Polarity is an unusual development of the negative form of verbs, in which the negation suffix detached from the auxiliary verb, possibly by analogy with the affirmative particle <em>tō</em>. The negative particle is <em>mō</em>. These particles can also occur with nouns and adjectives, although in those cases they act as proclitics instead or enclitic particles.</p>

			<!--
			-poik
			break: r-s-p
			see: q-t-v
			through = in & out:
				in = kösy
				out = köstö

			k-s-t: hole
			c-s-t: open
			large: l-k-r
			small: s-l-m

			qutevu-z köstö: I look through
				köqystöv = window
				köCysCöC verb-through

			think: n-t-l syntactically active, semantically passive
			“know” is syntactically active, semantically active
			“teach” is causative know/think
			know n-t-l → teach


			Köqystövāš īrusepu mā jāša kozym-poik.
			Köqystöva-ːš	ī-r_C1-u-s_c2-e-p_C3-u 										ma-ː 			ja-ːš-a 						kozy-m=poik
			window-prm	3;inanim.prm-break_C1-v-_C2-1sg.nom-_C3-v	3sg-nom		1sg-prm-nom 			pftv.pl.trns.decl-ewts=caus
			S/he made me break the window.

			-->

			<!--<h2>Telicity</h2>
			<p>Telicity refers to the completeness of a verb, i.e. whether or not the intended result was achieved. Qevesa has a pair of enclitic particles that perform this, <em>kiri</em></p>

			<h2>Polarity</h2>
			<p>The original negative mood suffix <em>-in</em> could be applied to all other moods. This created the <strong>prohibitive mood</strong> when it merged with the imperative; for other moods the negative separated into an enclitic particle <em>ňo</em>, possibly by analogy with the affirmative <em>tō</em>.</p>

			<h2>Interrogative</h2>
			<p>The original interrogative mood suffix followed a similar path to the negative mood, forming an interrogative enclitic particle <em>-so</em>.</p>
-->
			<!--<h2>Particles</h2>
			<p>There are a number of particles, normally enclitic, that may be used to indicate additional information. When there is more than one particle attached to a verb, they are fusionally conjoined.</p>
			<h3>Active Voice</h3>
			<p>Intrasitive verbs may be followed by the particle <em>le</em>, which basically states that the sole argument was in control of the action rather than being simply an experiencer.</p>
			<h3>Telicity</h3>
			<p>Telicity, or resultivity, can be indicated with the particle <em>kuo</em>.</p>
			<h3>Negation</h3>
			<p>Negation in Qevesa is achieved through use of the adverbial/prepositional particle <em>niširo</em> ("not"). Alternatively, negation may be indicated by the postpositonal particle <em>ně</em>.</p>-->
			<!--<ul>
				<li><em>A vukulkos sokóinusěr.</em> DEF article-ACC write-1SG.IPF "I wrote the article (and completed it; it was published)."</li>
				<li><em>A vukulkos sokóinusěr<strong>veš</strong>.</em> DEF article-ACC write-1SG.IPF-ATL "I wrote the article (but did not complete it)."</li>
				<li><em>A vukulkos sokóinukěr.</em> DEF article-ACC write-1SG.PFT "I have written the article (and completed it)."</li>
				<li><em>A vukulkos sokóinukěr<strong>veš</strong>.</em> DEF article-ACC write-1SG.PFT-ATL "I have written the article (completed)."</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The last example implies that the particular occurrence of the action has ended, although the final goal is yet to be achieved.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><em>Laikulusěrztu.</em> fish.PRG.V-1PL.IPF-PRG "We went fishing (and caught something)."</li>
				<li><em>Laikulusěrztu<strong>veš</strong>.</em> fish.PRG.V-1PL.IPF-PRG-ATL "We went fishing (but did not catch anything)."</li>
				<li><em>Laikulukěrztu.</em> fish.PRG.V-1PL.PFT-PRG "We have been fishing (and caught something)."</li>
				<li><em>Laikulukěrztu<strong>veš</strong>.</em> fish.PRG.V-1PL.PFT-PRG-ATL "We have been fishing (but did not catch anything)."</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Again, the last example indicates that the instance of the action had finished occurring, however its goal was not achieved.</p>-->
			<!--<p>As can be seen from the examples, the suffix for telicity is <em>-veš</em>.</p>-->

			<h2>Nominalisations</h2>
			<p>As Qevesa is based on triconsonantal roots, most nouns are formed from verb roots, and each root can produce a variety of nominal forms.</p>

			<h3>Concept</h3>
			<p class="strong">CeCeC</p>
			<p>This is a general nominalisation representing the concept, process, activity or ability.</p>

			<h3>Actor</h3>
			<p class="strong">CaCoC</p>
			<p>A person that performs the action.</p>

			<h3>Patient</h3>
			<p class="strong">CoCCit</p>
			<p>Something that undergoes the action.</p>

			<!--
				nurture: n-t-m
				→ notmisiro: boy
				→ notmisisse: girl


			-->

			<h3>Resulting Object</h3>
			<p class="strong">CiCāC</p>
			<p>An object resulting from the action.</p>

			<h3>Art</h3>
			<p class="strong">CeCöCa</p>
			<p>Names an art, skill, or science.</p>

			<h3>Device</h3>
			<p class="strong">CeC~äC</p>
			<p>A non-human object that performs the action.</p>

			<h3>Instrument</h3>
			<p class="strong">CīCuC</p>
			<p>A tool or object used to perform the action.</p>

			<h3>Location</h3>
			<p class="strong">aCCēC</p>
			<p>A place where the action is performed.</p>

			<p>Gender specific variants of the above nominalisations can be formed with the suffixes <em>-(i)ro</em> and <em>-(i)sse</em>.</p>

			<!--<h2>Compound Verbs</h2>
			<p>In addition to the basic verbs formed by the morphological processes described above, verbs can also be compounded to convey additional meaning. There are two primary methods of compounding: enclitics/suffixes that attach to the auxiliary verb; and proclitics/prefixes that attach to the primary verb. Enclitics on the auxiliary verb are normally used to indicate the manner in which the action is performed, and proclitics on the primary verb are normally used to indicate additional objects and the like. Both of these constructions are extremely productive, and in some (relatively rare) cases are used to create roots with four or more consonants.</p>-->
