			<h1>Verbal Morphology</h1>
			<h2>Verb Roots and Classes</h2>
			<p>Qevesa has six classes of verbs, which differ in the final character of the root. These can be readily distinguished by the process used to form the infinitive.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Class 1</strong> verbs have roots ending in a consonant, <em>-i</em>, <em>-u</em> or <em>-y</em>.</li>
				<li><strong>Class 2</strong> verbs have roots ending in <em>-a</em> or <em>-ä</em>.</li>
				<li><strong>Class 3</strong> verbs have roots ending in <em>-e</em> or <em>-ö</em>.</li>
				<li><strong>Class 4</strong> verbs have roots ending in <em>-ë</em>.</li>
				<li><strong>Class 5</strong> verbs have roots ending in <em>-o</em>.</li>
				<li><strong>Class 6</strong> verbs comprise the majority of irregular verbs, and end in <em>-uor(-)</em> with an optional final vowel.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There are also a number of irregular verbs, which will be discussed later.</p>

			<h2>The Infinitive</h2>
			<p>The infinitive is formed by the following processes; stem final vowels are dropped where they exist:</p>
			<table cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<th>Verb Class</th>
					<th>Suffix</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>1</th>
					<td>-ul</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>2</th>
					<td>-aul</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>3</th>
					<td>-öl</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>4</th>
					<td>-jol</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>5</th>
					<td>-uol</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>6</th>
					<td>-ajal</td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<h2>Person</h2>
			<p>Verbs are often conjugated to person to indicate the agent. Personal forms are created by adding the personal pronoun suffix to the verb stem; the following table outlines the endings.</p>
			<table cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<th>1 sg</th>
					<td>-ër</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>2 sg</th>
					<td>-tar</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>3 sg</th>
					<td>-mir</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>1 pl</th>
					<td>-jor</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>2 pl</th>
					<td>-tur</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>3 pl</th>
					<td>-mur</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Focus</th>
					<td>-kar</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>When the agent does not consist of a pronoun, conjugation to person is optional. In this case, the final character of the verb form is duplicated.</p>

			<h2>Aspect and Mood</h2>
			<p>Qevesa has five aspects (stative imperfective, dynamic imperfective, perfective, retrospective, delimitative), five moods (indicative, conditional, potential, cohortative, imperative). Tense is not indicated on the verb; if time must be indicated it is done by using a noun in the essive case. A verb cannot have more than one aspect, nor can it possess more than a single mood. These moods/aspects are formed using the following patterns:</p>
			<table cellspacing="0">
				<tr>
					<th>Aspect/Mood</th>
					<th>Formation</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Stative Imperfective</th>
					<td>-v(-)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Dynamic Imperfective</th>
					<td>-k(-)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Perfective</th>
					<td>-t(-)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Retrospective</th>
					<td>-s(-)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Delimitative</th>
					<td>-q(-)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Indicative</th>
					<td>-Ø(-)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Conditional</th>
					<td>-om(-)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Potential</th>
					<td>-es(-)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Cohortative</th>
					<td>-an(-)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>Imperative</th>
					<td>Consists of the infinitive + <em>-ir</em>.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>When the person is not explicitly marked, the final letter of the aspect/mood suffix is doubled on all but the imperative.</p>

			<h2>Particles</h2>
			<p>There are a number of particles, normally enclitic, that may be used to indicate additional information. When there is more than one particle attached to a verb, they are fusionally conjoined.</p>
			<h3>Active Voice</h3>
			<p>Intrasitive verbs may be followed by the particle <em>le</em>, which basically states that the sole argument was in control of the action rather than being simply an experiencer.</p>
			<h3>Telicity</h3>
			<p>Telicity, or resulativity, can be indicated with the particle <em>kuo</em>.</p>
			<h3>Negation</h3>
			<p>Negation in Qevesa is achieved through use of the adverbial/prepositional particle <em>niširo</em> ("not"). Alternatively, negation may be indicated by the postpositonal particle <em>në</em>.</p>
			<!--<ul>
				<li><em>A vukulkos ňokóinusër.</em> DEF article-ACC write-1SG.IPF "I wrote the article (and completed it; it was published)."</li>
				<li><em>A vukulkos ňokóinusër<strong>veš</strong>.</em> DEF article-ACC write-1SG.IPF-ATL "I wrote the article (but did not complete it)."</li>
				<li><em>A vukulkos ňokóinukër.</em> DEF article-ACC write-1SG.PFT "I have written the article (and completed it)."</li>
				<li><em>A vukulkos ňokóinukër<strong>veš</strong>.</em> DEF article-ACC write-1SG.PFT-ATL "I have written the article (completed)."</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The last example implies that the particular occurrence of the action has ended, although the final goal is yet to be achieved.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><em>Laikulusërztu.</em> fish.PRG.V-1PL.IPF-PRG "We went fishing (and caught something)."</li>
				<li><em>Laikulusërztu<strong>veš</strong>.</em> fish.PRG.V-1PL.IPF-PRG-ATL "We went fishing (but did not catch anything)."</li>
				<li><em>Laikulukërztu.</em> fish.PRG.V-1PL.PFT-PRG "We have been fishing (and caught something)."</li>
				<li><em>Laikulukërztu<strong>veš</strong>.</em> fish.PRG.V-1PL.PFT-PRG-ATL "We have been fishing (but did not catch anything)."</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Again, the last example indicates that the instance of the action had finished occurring, however its goal was not achieved.</p>-->
			<!--<p>As can be seen from the examples, the suffix for telicity is <em>-veš</em>.</p>-->

			<!--<h2>The Gerund</h2>
			<p>The gerund is not an actual verb form, but a derived substantive that can be used as a noun or adjective, and hence to derive more words. However, the gerund cannot be used as the verb in a subphrase. The same applies for the infinitive verb; in fact, the only difference between the gerund and the infinitive is that the infinitive ends in <em>-ur</em> instead of <em>-ut</em>.</p>-->
			<!-- PARTICIPLE -->
			<!-- -->

<!-- UP TO HERE!!! -->
			<!--<h2>A Special Case: The Copula</h2>
			<p>As in most other languages, the copula is an irregular verb. It can exist as a stative suffix on an adjective or adverb for simple subject-predicate clauses, or as a stand alone verb in more complicated clauses. It normally uses the imperfective aspect to represent continuous states and the perfective aspect to represent temporary states; a completed state will use the retrospective aspect.</p>
			<p>Person is not marked on the copula except:</p>
			<ul class="nobullet">
				<li>when the subject is referenced with a focus pronoun;</li>
				<li>when confusion or ambiguity would result from not doing so;</li>
				<li>or for special emphasis.</li>
			</ul>-->
