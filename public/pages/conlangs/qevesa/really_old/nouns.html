			<h1>Nominal Morphology</h1>
			<p>Qevesa makes a distinction between proper and common nouns. Proper nouns are always capitalised, whereas common nouns are only capitalised at the start of a sentence.</p>
			<h2>Noun Declension</h2>
			<p>Nouns possess number (singular, plural) and case (eight, described below); the definite article (there is no true indefinite article). There are 6 noun declensions or classes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>First Declension</strong> consists of all stems that end in a consonant.</li>
				<li><strong>Second Declension</strong> consists of all stems that end in <em>-a</em> or <em>-o</em>.</li>
				<li><strong>Third Declension</strong> consists of all stems that end in <em>-ä</em> or <em>-ö</em>.</li>
				<li><strong>Fourth Declension</strong> consists of all stems that end in <em>-e</em>, <em>-i</em> or <em>-y</em>.</li>
				<li><strong>Fifth Declension</strong> consists of all stems that end in <em>-u</em>.</li>
				<li><strong>Sixth Declension</strong> consists of all stems that end in <em>-ë</em> or any diphthong.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The second and third declensions are the most common, and they do not lose their final vowel, whereas the fourth, fifth and sixth declensions drop their final vowel. The sixth declension is possibly the least common.</p>
			<p>The eight cases are the dechticaetiative, ergative, accusative, partitive, genitive, essive, translative and postpositional cases:</p>

			<h2>Plurals</h2>
			<p>The plural can be marked with three different methods:</p>
			<h3>Dechticaetiative Plural</h3>
			<p>This form is used for nouns in the dechticaetiative case. It is formed by adding the dechticaetiative suffix and <em>-vit</em>.</p>
			<h3>Inflected Plural</h3>
			<p>This form is used for nouns in all other cases. It is formed by declining the noun to the partitive case, and then declining the noun to the desired case.</p>
			<h3>Numerical Plural</h3>
			<p>This plural is related to the inflected plural in that it preserves the former plural marker. It is used only following numbers greater than one, when the number is explicitly stated. It is formed by declining the noun to the dechticaetiative case, adding the suffix <em>-it</em>, and then declining the noun to the desired case.</p>
			<p>Note that the inflected and numerical plurals cause the noun to become a 1<sup>st</sup> Declension noun, as it ends in a consonant.</p>

			<h2>Articles</h2>
			<h3>The Definite Article</h3>
			<p>The definite article has is the more commonly used; strictly speaking, there is no indefinite article. It has two forms (similar to <em>a</em> and <em>an</em> in English):</p>
			<ul>
				<li><em>a</em> is used before words beginning with a consonant.</li>
				<li><em>as</em> is used before words beginning with a vowel.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>The Indefinite Article</h3>
			<p>Strictly speaking, there is no indefinite article in Qevesa; the numeral <em>one</em> is used instead. Consequently, it is not used as often as its English counterpart, as it specifically expresses the concept of "one". One unusual use of the indefinite article is to negate nouns. Unlike the definite article, the indefinite article agrees in case with the noun it modifies.</p>
