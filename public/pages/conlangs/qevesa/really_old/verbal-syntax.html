			<h1>Verbal Syntax</h1>


			<h2>Use of the Infinitive</h2>
			<p>The infinitive is formed by the following processes; stem final vowels are dropped where they exist:</p>


			<h2>Person</h2>


			<h2>Aspects and Moods</h2>

			<h3>Perfective</h3>
			<p>The perfective aspect indicates an action viewed as a single whole.</dd>

			<h3>Imperfective</h3>
			<p>The imperfective aspect indicates continuous or habitual states and actions.</p>

			<h3>Retrospective</h3>
			<p>The retrospective aspect refers to a previous action viewed from the perspective of a later time.</p>

			<h3>Indicative</h3>
			<p>The indicative is used for factual statements and positive beliefs.</p>

			<h3>Conditional</h3>
			<p>The conditional refers to an action whose realisation is dependent on a certain condition.</p>

			<h3>Potential</h3>
			<p>The potential is a mood of probability, indicating that the action or occurrence is considered likely.</p>

			<h3>Cohortative</h3>
			<p>The cohortative is used to express plea, insistence, imploring, self-encouragement, wish, desire, intent, command, purpose or consequence.</p>

			<h3>Admirative</h3>
			<p>The admirative is used to express surprise, doubt and occasionally sarcasm.</p>

			<h3>Imperative</h3>
			<p>The imperative is used to indicate commands. It is only used with the second person, and in contrast to the others, consists of the infinitive with the person suffix.</p>

			<p>English examples of the usage of the above aspects and moods: <em>(using "to speak")</em></p>

			<h3>Negation</h3>
			<p>Negation in Qevesa is achieved through use of the adverbial particle <em>niširo</em>.</p>
<!--
			<h2>Telicity</h2>
			<p>Telicity in Qevesa refers to whether a result is obtained from the action, rather than whether the action is completed (completion is indicated by the perfective/imperfective aspects). Some examples follow:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><em>A vukulkos ňokóinusër.</em> DEF article-ACC write-1SG.IPF "I wrote the article (and completed it; it was published)."</li>
				<li><em>A vukulkos ňokóinusër<strong>veš</strong>.</em> DEF article-ACC write-1SG.IPF-ATL "I wrote the article (but did not complete it)."</li>
				<li><em>A vukulkos ňokóinukër.</em> DEF article-ACC write-1SG.PFT "I have written the article (and completed it)."</li>
				<li><em>A vukulkos ňokóinukër<strong>veš</strong>.</em> DEF article-ACC write-1SG.PFT-ATL "I have  written the article (completed)."</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The last example implies that the particular occurrence of the action has ended, although the final goal is yet to be achieved.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><em>Laikulusërztu.</em> fish.PRG.V-1PL.IPF-PRG "We went fishing (and caught something)."</li>
				<li><em>Laikulusërztu<strong>veš</strong>.</em> fish.PRG.V-1PL.IPF-PRG-ATL "We went fishing (but did not catch anything)."</li>
				<li><em>Laikulukërztu.</em> fish.PRG.V-1PL.PFT-PRG "We have been fishing (and caught something)."</li>
				<li><em>Laikulukërztu<strong>veš</strong>.</em> fish.PRG.V-1PL.PFT-PRG-ATL "We have been fishing (but did not catch anything)."</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Again, the last example indicates that the instance of the action had finished occurring, however its goal was not achieved.</p>
			<p>As can be seen from the examples, the suffix for telicity is <em>-veš</em>.</p>-->

			<!--<h2>The Gerund</h2>
			<p>The gerund is not an actual verb form, but a derived substantive that can be used as a noun or adjective, and hence to derive more words. However, the gerund cannot be used as the verb in a subphrase. The same applies for the infinitive verb; in fact, the only difference between the gerund and the infinitive is that the infinitive ends in <em>-ur</em> instead of <em>-ut</em>.</p>-->
			<!-- PARTICIPLE -->
			<!-- -->

<!-- UP TO HERE!!! -->
			<h2>A Special Case: The Copula</h2>
			<p>As in most other languages, the copula is an irregular verb. It can exist as a stative suffix on an adjective or adverb for simple subject-predicate clauses, or as a stand alone verb in more complicated clauses. It normally uses the imperfective aspect to represent continuous states and the perfective aspect to represent temporary states; a completed state will use the retrospective aspect.</p>
			<dl class="gloss">
				<dt>Lisa turlot<em>uottutt</em>, ëki zibisa <em>ottukkar</em>.</dt>
				<dd>Lisa.DCHT this.one.COP.PFV, 1SG.GEN sister-DCHT COP-IPV-FOC</dd>
				<dd>This is my sister Lisa. (This one is Lisa, my sister she is being)</dd>
<!--
				<dt>Žulija svori kuvali<em>ottukk</em>.</dt>
				<dd>Julia.DCHT very.ADV beautiful-COP-PFV</dd>
				<dd>Julia is very beautiful.</dd>
-->
			</dl>
			<p>Person is not marked on the copula except:</p>
			<ul class="nobullet">
				<li>when the subject is referenced with a focus pronoun;</li>
				<li>when confusion or ambiguity would result from not doing so;</li>
				<li>or for special emphasis.</li>
			</ul>
