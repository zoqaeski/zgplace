			<h1 class="title">Qevesa Grammar</h1>
			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Qevesa is the native language of approximately 7.8 million people, most of whom reside in the country of Qevelia, where the language is official. </p>
			<h2>History</h2>
			<p>Modern Qevesa is the result of an effort to combine the regional dialects of Old Qevesa into a single standard language. It is a member of the Teralo family of languages, and is a direct descendent of Proto-Teralo, the language spoken by the original inhabitants of the continent. Its nearest relatives are spoken in the far south east of Teralia, and Qevesa is geographically isolated due to the mountainous terrain of Qevelia.</p>
			<p>The geographical isolation is apparent in that Qevesa possesses some features that have disappeared in its neighbours, namely an active-stative morphosyntactic alignment and a fairly comprehensive set of cases.</p>
