			<h1>About this site</h1>

			<p>This site was written by Zoqaeski, and it was mostly hand coded using <a href="http://www.vim.org">Vim</a>. The site was optimised for modern browsers such as <a href="http://www.chromium.org/chromium-projects">Chromium</a> and <a href="http://www.mozilla.com">Firefox</a>, and has been tested with the latest (relatively) stable versions of each of these. The pages are rendered by a <a href="http://www.php.org">PHP</a> application that I wrote, which in turn relies on an <a href="http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net">excellent DOM parser</a>.</p>

			<p>Both the <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> have been validated with the W3C's <a href="http://validator.w3.org">validator service</a> to ensure compliance. Please note that some features may not work in other browsers to those listed above.</p>
