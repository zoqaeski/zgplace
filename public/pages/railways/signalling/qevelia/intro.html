			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>These pages describe the signalling and safeworking of Qevelian Railways (Qevelëk Zéšovárva).</p>

			<h2>Basic Terminology</h2>

			<h3>Stations and Blocks</h3>
			<p>Qevelian safeworking maintains a strong distinction between stations and the open line, with slightly different types of signals used for each area, although the regulations have been repeatedly adjusted and standardised over the years. In the safeworking rules, a station <!--insert Qevesa term when translated-->is an area of track between opposing home signals that nearly always contains at least one turnout. It is a location where trains permitted on the open line may originate, terminate, cross or pass, or diverge to a different route. The tracks outside of the home signal limits is referred to as the open line. Stations do not need to have platforms where a train may make a scheduled halt, and platforms can be located on the open line.</p>

			</div>
			<p>There are three main types of home signal, although these are not distinguished in most cases. These are <em>accepting signals</em>, which protect the entrance to a station zone; <em>intermediate home signals</em>, which protect obstructions within the home signal limits; and <em>starting signals</em>, which mark the end of the home signal limits and the beginning of the open line. Accepting signals are always placed at least 200 metres before the first turnouts or potential obstructions to the so-called entry route; home signals are similarly located before obstructions to the exit route, although they do not need to have as long an overlap. The starting signal is often located adjacent to the opposing accepting signal. The actual boundary between the home signal limits and the open line depends on the direction of traffic; the departure route has an overlap that extends between the last intermediate home signal and the starting signal, but the entry route has a much shorter overlap usually defined as being half the distance between the accepting signal and the first point of obstruction.</p>
			<p>Larger stations may be divided into smaller operating areas, often each controlled by a separate signalbox, and have intermediate home signals which are both exit signals for their own interlocking and entry signals for the next. Such stations always have a command box which will coordinate interlocking between the dependent boxes. The principles of station interlocking is described on the <a href="/railways/signalling/qevelia/interlocking">appropriate page</a>.</p>
			<p>The open line is usually divided into blocks, whose length varies based on the amount of traffic and the alignment of the line. The general rule is that busier uphill lines will have more blocks than less busy downhill lines; however, to reduce the number of manned block posts on double track manual block operated lines compromises will often be made to ensure that both directions have a block boundary in the same location. On automatic block territory this is not necessarily the case; single-track lines will always have block boundaries for opposing directions in the same location irrespective of whether the system is manual or automatic.</p>

			<h3>Types of Movements</h3>
			<p>Correpsonding with the distinction between stations and the open line, a distinction is also made between train and shunting movements. Train movements must only originate or terminate at a station, and are permitted to proceed on the open line according to the working timetable and main signal indications, with speed limits prescribed by both lineside speed and curve signs and the timetable. In contrast, shunting movements are not permitted to leave the station area unless timetabled to do so (in which case they may be promoted to a train movement), and are governed within the station by shunting signals and verbal orders. Shunting movements are also speed limited to a maximum of 45 km/h, although lower limits are often enforced.</p>
			<p>A main signal is never cleared for a shunting movement, but some shunting signals must be cleared to permit a train movement. If a shunting movement is to enter a main track, the point operator must get permission from the train director. Shunting movements must never leave home signal limits. However, on double track lines, shunting movements may use the departure track (i.e. the left-hand track) to move vehicles from one station track to another, provided no train is approaching on that track. If a train is approaching, the train director can establish a temporary shunting limit with sufficient overlap and clearance to protect both trains. In contrast to the departure track, the arrival track (i.e. the right-hand track) has a permanent shunting limit, located at the end of the entry overlap and marked by a shunt limit board.</p>
			<!--<h2>Differences between Railways and Roads</h2>
			<p>Most of you will be familiar with the road rules, and with traffic lights, in which motorists are given instructions on whether to stop or go. Railway signals are similar, however there is one big difference: on the road, a green signal says 'enter intersection on sight and proceed if clear', whereas a green signal on a railway guarantees that the section is free of other traffic.</p>
			<p>This means that railway signals need to be slightly more advanced than traffic lights - not only do they need to tell the driver if it is safe to proceed, but also what lies ahead, as it is usually too late to start braking once the driver sees the signal at stop.</p>
			<p>Of course, one could always automatically regulate the speed of each an every train electronically and remotely; however when railways first appeared on the scene such technology did not exist. A far simpler system was therefore devised: you divide the line into a number of sections, or <em>blocks</em>, and ensure that only one train is permitted into a block at any one time. Of course, this system is a little too simplisitic, as it does not take into account that a train may stop within a block due to unforeseen circumstances, so the usual modification is to ensure that a number of blocks after the train are also free of obstructions, thus giving any following trains the required distance and space in which to decelerate.</p>
			<p>As people are far from infallible, numerous devices and/or rules have been developed, from swinging lanterns to semaphore signals, colour light indications to in-cab signalling. These signal systems inform the driver of the state of the way ahead, of the direction he or she is to proceed, and other information relating to the operation of the trains.</p>
			<h2>Train Movements and Shunting Movements</h2>
			<p>Qevelian railway safeworking defines two different types of railway operations, <em>train movements</em> and <em>shunting movements</em>. A <strong>train movement</strong> is a scheduled train that is meant to leave the confines of a station and travel along the open line; a <strong>shunting movement</strong> is a non-scheduled train whose movement is confined to within the station limits.</p>
			<p>However, there are some exceptions to this rule:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>When a section of open line is closed for maintenance, any operations along it are defined as shunting movements.</li>
				<li>Some stations or yards are large enough to be broken into separate sections, each of which may be controlled by a signal box. If a movement is not timetabled, then it is a shunting movement.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Signalling</h2>
			<p>The primary system of signalling used on QZ is so-called "speed signalling". There are a number of different types of signal presently in use, including semaphore signals, several designs of colour-light signals, and in-cab signalling.</p>
			<p>Speed signalling indicates the speed at which the driver may proceed. Unlike many other systems, the Qevelian variant does not use the main signals to indicate track routes; these can be assumed based on the speed (i.e. an approaching turnout will necessitate a change in speed). At junctions a route indicator is often provided, especially where ambiguity may result from speed indications alone.</p>
			<h3>Placement of Signals</h3>
			<p>As trains in Qevelia primarily travel on the left, signals are nearly always placed to the left of the track they protect. Over multiple tracks signals may be mounted on top of gantries or suspended below overhead catenary supports, in both cases to the left of the track they protect. On sections of double track signalled for bidirectional traffic, signals may be mounted on the same post, with the wrong-side signal displaying a sign pointing to the correct track.</p>-->
			<!--<h3>Terminology</h3>
			<p>Before you start, the following terminology is used in this set of articles:</p>

			<h4>A note on units and measurements</h4>
			<p>The unusual speed limits given in the rules are multiples of 12, as a duodecimal number system is used in Qevelia (and in fact all of Teranë), but have been converted to decimal for simplicity. </p>
