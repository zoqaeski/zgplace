			<h1>Signals on Vehicles</h1>

			<p>There are a number of different signals and signs displayed on moving and stationary vehicles. </p>

			<h2>Signals on Train Movements</h2>

			<h3>Headlights</h3>

			<p>The leading end of a train movement is indicated by three white lights arranged in a triangle with the peak facing up. Headlights must be displayed by both day and night, but must be dimmed when: </p>

			<ul class="para">
				<li>approaching locations where train is scheduled to stop; </li>
				<li>standing within station limits; </li>
				<li>approaching trains in the opposite direction, until the locomotives or leading cabs have passed each other. The headlight must then be returned to ‘full on’. </li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Tail lights</h3>

			<p>The rear end of a train movement is indicated by one or two flashing red lights, and an end-of-train marker. Steady lights are permitted if lights are unable to be flashed. </p>

			<h3>Other lights</h3>

			<p>The rear end of a locomotive is indicated by a single white light located on the lower left-hand side. Multiple-unit consists operating as a single unit need only display tail light on rear locomotive. </p>
			
			<p>Assisting locomotives with a separate driver display both headlights and a rear light if leading. Non-leading locomotives propelled by an assisting locomotive display only the rear light. </p> 

			<p>Timetabled light-engine movements must display headlights and tail lights. Multiple locomotives operating as a light movement need only display headlights on first locomotive and tail lights on last locomotive; intermediate locomotives need not display white rear lights.

			<h2>Shunting Movements</h2>

			<p>Shunting movements are indicated by two horizontal white lights on the leading end. Light shunting locomotives must display two horizontal white lights on each end. </p>
