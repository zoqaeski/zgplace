			<h1>Cab Signalling: Linear Train Control</h1>

			<p>Limitiations in the inductive system and a desire to increase train speeds without realigning block boundaries led to the development of a new train control system, capable of finer speed limits and transmission of additional information to the trains. Unlike the inductive system, this system is continuous, relying on cable loops located between the rails to send and receive telegrams to and from the trains that contain the necessary information. </p>

			<h2>History</h2>

			<p class="em">(To be written...)</p>

			<h2>Infrastructure</h2>

			<p>The system consists of both lineside and train-borne equipment, and is a form of centralised traffic control. Train control centres are located approximately 30–40 km apart or at major stations. </p>

			<h3>Lineside Equipment</h3>

			<p> Conductive cable loops, located between the rails, are used to communicate between the control centre and trains in the section. The loops can range in length from 50 m to just over 13 km; loops longer than 100 m are divided into 100 m sections by crossing the cables. The train detects the crossing of the cables by the change in phase angle and uses this to help determine its position. To avoid disruption to the entire section if a cable is damaged, loops are physically broken into 300 m lengths. Each of these is fed by repeaters that ensure that all of the loops within a section transmit the same information. </p>

			<p>The train control centres consist of a 2-of-3 computer system with two computers connected to the output and the third as a reserve. All three receive and process input data and interchange their outputs and intermediate results. If one computer disagrees, it is exchanged with the reserve computer. Each computer is physically separate, with its own power supply and frame. </p>

			<p>All of the computers for a section are programmed with the fixed information for that section, including gradients, speed limits, locations of block boundaries, turnouts and signals. They are linked to the interlocking system(s) and signal boxes of the section, from which they receive information about turnout positions, signal indications and track occupancy. </p>

			<p>Other equipment includes fixed loops that transmit start and end telegrams, sectioning cabinets, and lineside signs that indicate the location of block boundaries. </p>

			<h3>Train-borne equipment</h3>

			<p>There are three core train-borne components: </p>

			<ul class="para">
				<li>An antenna mounted underneath the locomotive receives and sends telegrams to and from the control centre. </li>
				<li>An onboard computer, consisting of a 2-of-3 system, that decodes the telegrams and calculates the speed limits and braking curves. If the driver does not take the correct actions, the computer system applies the brakes and controls the train appropriately. </li>
				<li>The driver display unit presents the driver with the necessary information, including the current permissable speed, the current actual speed, the target speed limit, and the distance until the target is reached. Other information, such as the system status, is also displayed. </li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Operation</h2>

			<p>Linear Train Control operates by sending data packets, or telegrams, between the control centre and the trains. The <em>call telegrams</em> are transmitted at <abbr title="1152 bits per viukit">1348 bits per second</abbr> using frequency-shift keying on a 36 kHz ± 0.4 kHz carrier, and the train replies with a <em>response telegram</em> transmitted at <abbr="576 bits per viukit">674 bits per second</abbr> on a 60 kHz ± 0.2 kHz carrier. </p>

			<p>As with lineside signal systems, LTC-equipped track is still divided into blocks of approximately 1200 to 2400 metres long (and sometimes as short as 300 m). Some new high-speed bypass lines omit fixed signals at each block boundary, providing only Accepting and Starting signals stations and crossovers; distant signals are not required so <a href="/railways/signalling/qevelia/lineside_signs#Landmark_signs">landmark signs</a> are provided instead. </p>

			<p>The busiest main lines have been upgraded with LTC as an overlay system, retaining the existing lineside signalling infrastructure. </p>

			<h3>Telegram Format</h3>
			<p>There are a number of different types of telegram that the infrastructure is capable of transmitting. All the telegrams contain a header followed by data fields. Unless otherwise specified, negative integers are represented in <em>one’s complement notation</em>; the resulting positive and negative zero is used to determine direction. <!--For more information on the packet variables, see <a href="/railways/signalling/qevelia/cab_appendix#List_of_Packet_Variables">the appendix</a>, as the listing is too long to include here.--> </p>

			<h3>List of Telegrams</h3>

			<h4>Call Telegrams</h4>

			<p>There are ?? call telegrams that can be sent to a train. Each transmits a different kind of movement authority or other information necessary for safe operation. </p>

			<h5>Movement Authority Call Telegram</h5>

			<p>This is the basic telegram transmitted to the train from the central computer. It is usually transmitted between one and six times a second. </p>

			<h5>Change of Section</h5>

			<p>This telegram is transmitted when the train is about to change section, either at the entry of an LTC controlled line, at the boundary between sections, or when changing tracks. After receiving this telegram, the train will ignore all telegrams not specifically addressed to it, so this telegram is the last sent before one of these operations takes place. </p>

			<p>The <code>N_AXLES</code> variable is used for automated train integrity checking. Axle counters normally increment when a train enters a block, and decrement when the train leaves the block: if the total is zero, then it can be inferred that the block is free of obstructions.

			<h3>Addressing and Zones</h3>

			<p>Before departure the driver must enter the train details into the onboard computer and enable LTC. These details are then used to compute the acceleration and deceleration curves and permissable speeds. </p>

			<p>A LTC section is divided into a maximum of 127 zones, each 102.528 m long. The zones are consecutively numbered, from ±1–127, using positive integers in the normal direction of travel and negative integers in the opposite direction (the sign is indicated using one’s complement). When a train enters an LTC controlled section, it will pass over a fixed loop that transmits a “<a href="#Change_of_Section">change of section</a>” telegram. This telegram indicates to the train the starting zone and initial maximum speed. From then on, the train’s location is used to identify it. When a train enters a new zone, it sends a response telegram indicating that it has advanced into a new zone. The central controller will then use the new zone when addressing the train in the future. As a train travels along the section, its address will either increase or decrease, depending on the direction. A train identifies that it has entered a new zone either by detecting the cable transition point or when it has travelled 100 metres. </p> 

			<p>This procedure for entering LTC controlled sections of track is repeated when a train transitions from one section to another. It also occurs if the train switches to a different track, such as the opposite track for bi-directional operation. The train receives a new “change of section” telegram and is given its new starting address. </p>

			<h3>Speed Signalling</h3>

			<p>The main function of LTC is signalling to the train its permitted speed and distance it has authorisation to travel. Telegrams are sent periodically to each train between one and six times a second, depending on the density of traffic on the section. </p>

			<h4>Determining the target speed</h4>

			<p>The permissable speed of the train is calculated based on its type (passenger/freight), braking curve, and maximum speed. There are four fields in the call telegram that are particularly relevant to the operation of the train: </p>

			<ul>
				<li>Target distance</li>
				<li>Current speed</li>
				<li>Target speed</li>
				<li>Average Gradient</li>
				<!--<li>Nominal stopping distance</li>-->
				<!--<li>Distance to brake application point</li>-->
			</ul>

			<p>The target distance is the distance until a speed change, and the target speed is the new value; the current speed is the permitted speed up to the target distance. The gradient information allows the train to take into account the average gradient of the block in determining stopping distances. </p>

			<p>The on-board equipment continuously calculates the permitted speed so that a train, decelerating according to its braking curve, will stop before the obstruction. </p>

			<!--<div class="nbox">

			</div>-->

			<!--<p>Here, <em>b</em> is the rate of deceleration, <em>s<sub>nominal</sub></em> is the nominal braking distance, and <em>s<sub>dist</sub></em> is the distance since the train received the last telegram, normally the start of the zone. The periodic telegrams from the central computer update the <em>s<sub>nominal</sub></em> variable; if the train loses contact, it will brake to a complete stop. The system is therefore inherently fail-safe. </p>-->

			<p>When a train is approaching a decreasing change in maximum speed (a signal at Stop or an occupied block is indicated with a speed limit of 0), the central computer will send a telegram with the target distance set to the point at which the restriction applies. The train will continuously calculate its permitted speed so that it arrives at the target point at the correct speed. When the target limit is higher than the present limit, the onboard computer waits until the train has passed its own length past the target point before recalculating the speed limit. </p>

			<!--<p>A train travelling at a constant velocity will receive telegrams that specify the nominal braking distance for that speed. If the speed limit decreases, the distance decreases accordingly; if the speed limit increases, then at the point where the higher speed takes effect, the distance will be updated. </p>-->
