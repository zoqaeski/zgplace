			<h1 class="title">Signalling and Safeworking <span class="subtitle">of the Qevelian Railways</span></h1>

			<h1>History</h1>
			<h2>Development of the Semaphore signal</h2>
			<p>The original design of railway signals, in the form of semaphore arms, was based on upper quadrant gates. To let traffic pass, the gate would be lifted up; a horizontal gate poses a physical barrier to the movement of traffic. Thus, from the outset, there never were lower quadrant signals in use on the Qevelian railways. The early signals were two position: vertical and horizontal; and were placed at the entrances to stations and intermediate blocks. The night aspects of these signals were white (or no colour) for <span class="sc">clear</span>, and red for <span class="sc">stop</span>. The actual semaphore arm was painted red.</p>
			<p>As train speeds increased, it became necessary to provide some form of advance warning to inform the driver that the home signal is at stop, so that the train could brake in time. Originally a variant of the home signal with a permanent vertical marker board similar in design to the home signal blade (that displayed a white light at night) was used. These distant signals were usually worked by wire, because the length of rodding that would be required was so great, and there were difficulties in controlling a signal located around a curve with a rod-worked mechanisms.</p>
			<p>For simple track layouts, this was all that was required. However, complicated track layouts, such as those at junctions, required something more sophisticated to indicate to the driver which route he was to take. The first solution adopted was to have a number of home signals located on the same mast, numbered such that each signal stood for a particular route. This arrangement, whilst adopted enthusiastically, was considered confusing to the train crew, especially if they were unexperienced with the line. The night aspects were considered particularly confusing, consisting of a vertical array of red lights with a single white light to indicate the correct route. After a number of collisions when drivers passed signals they belived to show a clear route, a signalling and safeworking comittee was formed to decide on the best approach.</p>
			<p>The first agreement they came to was that the multiple separate signals for each route had to go. Instead, they proposed indicating whether the route was straight or diverging, by using a separate signal arm for each option. In between the two route arms, an arm indicating route occupancy was positioned; main signals were thus standardised to have three arms. Distant signals were still of the pattern white light above single arm; to avoid any possible confusion, the colour of the arm was changed from red to yellow and the roundels for night aspects were similarly modified. The route signals, like the home signals, were normally at <span class="sc">stop</span>, and were interlocked so that only a <span class="sc">straight</span>or a <span class="sc">diverging</span>route could be displayed at any one time. Additional variants were developed for main signals that could only give indications for a single route, be it straight or diverging; these had a target plate mounted either below (straight) or above (diverging) the main arm. To allow the driver to distinguish between the two primary variants at night, the spectacles of the main <span class="sc">clear</span>indication were changed to green; this practice eventually spread to all main and distant signals. The target board was only necessary during the day, so it was not lit.</p>

			<p>Some sections of track had stations located so close together that the home signal for the following block coincided with the distant signal for the next station. At first, the distant signals were attached below the main signals, but this was found to be awkward at best, reintroducing the multiple armed signals of previous years. Using the manual block system, a signal box was responsible for all signals in its control, so they would also set the distant signals for the next section. This was a major departure from earlier designs with distants operated by long range double wire systems. To reduce the number of arms required by combination main/distant signals, a third position at 45° was introduced to indicate <span class="sc">warning</span>. All three position signals were worked using double wire control, as this was mechanically simpler than attempting to achieve the same result with rodding. It was at about this time when the route signalling system was replaced with a speed signalling system, coming from the principle that a diverging route would be passed at a lower speed than a straight one. A further addition was the introduction of the third position at 45° on the speed indication signals, giving an advance warning of speed reduction.</p>
			<p>The first automatic signals were introduced to increase track capacity; operated by track circuits they were revolutionary at the time, allowing the railway to dispense with a large number of intermediate home signals. The automatic signals were designed as being neither home nor distant signals, but rather a combination of both in that they could be passed at when at stop (although at a restricted speed able to stop upon sight). Automatic signals were identified by pointed arms and staggered night aspects.</p>
			<p>The powered automatic signals were highly successful; their low amount of maintenance made them cheaper to keep in optimum condition as compared to the wire-worked home signals. Powered home signals soon began to be installed to replace wire worked ones when major maintenance was required, initially in large yards but eventually right across the countryside. Combined with air-operated pointwork, they made the interlocking of turnouts much simpler from both a maintenance perspective and from the signaller’s point of view, as he no longer had to shift mechanical levers.</p>
			<!--<h2>Electrification</h2>
			<p>The steep grades and lengthy tunnels of the Main Northern and Main Eastern lines made the operation of steam locomotives traumatic for the crews working them over the mountains. Partly to overcome this, but mainly to allow heavier loads to be hauled at higher speeds, a number of separate sections were electrified with different systems to test the practicality of electric operations. The four systems trialled were 1500 V, 3 kV DC, 12.5 kV 25 hz, and 16 kV 20 hz, all using overhead catenary.</p>
			<p>The first section to become operational, was the 67 km between Toš Āren and Ěvöry, which consists of the tunnel under the Sōkailma Pass and the descent to the next large town in the mountains. Although this particular stretch did not have the steepest gradients, nor the longest tunnels, it was chosen to test the electrification for main line service because the topography of the section allowed relatively easy access for engineering works. The alternating current system was chosen as the catenary would be lighter and the number of substations fewer; of the four systems tested it was the most successful.</p>-->

			<p>The first light-based signals were developed for very different reasons. Electrification of the tunnel under the Sōkailma Pass on the Main Northern line in 1608 allowed more than one train to be able to pass through the tunnel, rather than waiting for smoke to clear before proceeding, so the tunnel section was divided into eight blocks to increase capacity. As there was not the room to fit full size automatic semaphore signals, a type of colour-light signal was developed that gave the night aspects of the semaphores. The signal consisted of a three light main head, with a white marker light above it. Due to the perpetual darkness of the tunnel, the lights were able to be operated under relatively low power. These signals proved to be effective and efficient, so they were installed along the approaches to the tunnel, and in places where long distance visibility was limited due to curves, cuttings, or other tunnels over the rest of that particular line. In stations, where <span class="sc">medium</span>aspects were required, additional signal heads were installed that give the equivalent of the multiple arm semaphores.</p>

			<p>Since its construction in the 1560’s, the South Coast Main Line has been plauged by the thick ocean fogs that often rolled in when the prevailing winds were from southerly direction. This made sighting of fixed signals nearly impossible, and the lamps of the night aspects on the automatic upper quadrants were not powerful enough to pierce the mist. Test installations of the colour light signals described above on a short section in 1614 were only moderately successful, so a number of designs were trialled to test their potential for operating in the low visibility conditions. These included a higher-powered colour-light signal, similar to the earlier designs, but using reflectors; a new type of colour-light signal, often known as the ‘searchlight’, which displayed up to three colours from a single focussed lamp using a relay operated set of spectacles; and several designs of position light signals, which use arrays of single colour lights that mimic the semaphore arm arrangement. The two designs judged most successful were the searchlight and one of the position light signals that featured arrays of three lights. These designs were subjected to further tests, including their ability to withstand harsh winter frosts and snow, and the searchlights came out on top, by a narrow margin. Although they had moving parts inside them, they were found have a lower power consumption than the position light signals, and were less likely to be clogged up by heavy snowfalls.</p>

			<p>The aspects of the searchlights were identical to the night aspects of the three position semaphores they replaced, with one major difference: the uppermost and lowermost heads had blanks in their centre roundel, so they did not show unnecessary <span class="sc">stop</span>indications. Due to their compact design, dwarf variants of searchlights were also developed, and first used in the new Kirua Central Terminal.</p>
			<p>Seachlights had a further advantage: they were modular, and could be adapted to display only the aspects that were required by their location. As two-speed normal and medium speed signals both had two heads, albeit reversed, the normal speed signals received an additional target plate.</p>

			<p>For the time being there are still semaphores in a number of locations, although it is expected that these will be phased out in the next few years as their motors and gearing wear out.</p>

			<h2>Automatic Train Control and Cab Signalling</h2>
			<p>Despite the continual advances in the design and technology of lineside signals, systems relying on signal aspects alone depend on the driver of the train to heed the warnings provided and act accordingly. As people make mistakes, the potential for accidents remains; to overcome this, systems of automatic train control provide a backup if the driver fails to observe signals. The simplest form of train control is an automatic trip stop, a lever which is raised when the signal is at stop that trips an emergency brake valve on the leading vehicle. This system is used on the Kirua Metro as well as on a number of suburban operations around the country, and is all that may be needed with roughly equal sized trains travelling at lower speeds. However, on main lines where a whole range of different train types and weights operate at different speeds, such a system is impractical. More advanced systems have been developed which transmit, either continuously or intermittently, the state of the line ahead and the speed at which the driver may proceed.</p>
			<p>The Short South is the section of the South Coast Main Line between the capital, Kirua, and the second largest city, Dešva. It is part of the busiest route in the country, the North-South trunk line that connects the south western countries of Teraně with the northern coast, which possesses vast reserves of ore and is the natural habitat for the <em>qivid</em> plant, both valuable resources in the industrialised countries of the south. Due mainly to the high density traffic of the line, it was an early candidate for long distance electrification in the 1620’s. After the successful energising of the Sōkailma Pass, the section from Kirua (which was having its suburban network electrified at the time) to Dešva was electrified; a few years later the wires were extended on to Tonema. This occured a few years after the installation of the searchlight signals described above; as the ocean fogs were still causing some problems with the sighting of the signals, a cab signalling system was developed that used coded messages transmitted in the track circuits.</p>
			<p>This system greatly improved the operation of these lines in even the most adverse weather conditions, and was installed within a few years of the electrification. The carrier frequency of the coded messages had to be changed due to interferance with the 20 hz return current. Concurrent with the spread of colour light signals, the cab signalling system was eventually installed along every main line. This had the effect of requiring all main line locomotives to be fitted with the necessary apparatus.</p>
<!--			<p>This system was the standard for 50 years until the 1680’s, when an overlay system capable of broadening the range of permissable speeds was developed in conjunction with the variable speed signs. These two systems work in parallel; the newer system overrides the older one and regulates speed more efficiently. Due to this, the <span class="sc">medium speed</span>indications were changed to <span class="sc">speed limited</span>indications; i.e. there is no longer a fixed speed, and instead the speed is restricted by either a post plate (including speedboards), variable speed sign, or cab signal.</p>-->
