			<h1>Cab Signalling: Advanced Train Control</h1>

			<p>Limitiations in the inductive system and a desire to increase train speeds without realigning block boundaries led to the development of a new train control system, capable of enforcing more distinct speed restrictions and transmitting additional information to the train. </p>

			<h2>History</h2>

			<p class="em">(To be written...)</p>

			<h2>Infrastructure</h2>

			<p>The system consists of both lineside and train-borne equipment. </p>

			<h3>Lineside Equipment</h3>

			<p>The lineside equipment consists of arrays of two to five radio-frequency activated beacons positioned between the rails, called balises, and electronic cabinets that receive information from the signals and interlocking and encode it into telegrams to be sent by the balise as the train passes overhead. </p> 
				
			<p>A balise group is located at each signal and lineside sign of importance; the balises in each group are spaced approximately 2.4 metres apart. The group is read as a single telegram, that transmits signal, speed and other information to the train. At least two balises are required, so that a train can determine the direction (each balise transmits a different telegram), as a safety measure should one fail, and to increase the amount of data that can be transmitted. </p>

			<p>Balises are mass-produced and low-maintenance with an expected lifespan of 25 years. They can function through a wide range of conditions, from being frozen at -40°C to baked at 70°C, and are resistant to vibration and grime. The circuit board inside a balise is encased in a thick, elastic block of plastic. They do not need a power supply: balises receive their energy from the locomotive antenna, which transmits 18 watts at 27 MHz in pulses of 50 kHz. The antenna is pulsed to synchronise it with the onboard computer. The balise transmits its telegram to the receiver using amplitude-modulation at 4.5 MHz with 50 kbps. </p>

			<h3>Train-borne equipment</h3>

			<p>The train-borne equipment consists of the following components: </p>

			<ul class="para">
				<li>An antenna mounted underneath the locomotive that powers and receives telegrams from the balises.  </li>
				<li>Measuring equipment that determines the current speed and acceleration. </li>
				<li>An onboard computer, consisting of a 2-of-3 system, that decodes the telegrams and calculates the speed limits and braking curves. If the driver does not take the correct actions, the computer system applies the brakes and controls the train appropriately. </li>
				<li>The driver display unit presents the driver with the necessary information, including the current permissable speed, the current actual speed, the target speed limit, and the distance until the target is reached. Other information, such as the system status, is also displayed. </li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Operation</h2>

			<p>As the train passes over a balise group, it powers and receives telegrams from the group that indicate the type of information, the speed restrictions, gradients, and distance to the next group. Different lineside equipment have different combinations of balises. The balises in a group are numbered A, B, C, etc; main signals typically have two balises, the first indicates the telegram type, and the second indicates the speed and distance information. A third balise may be installed if there is a gradient that affects braking distances. </p>
