			<h1>Track and Signal Numbering</h1>

			<p>Tracks, signals and other items of infrastructure are numbered in the <em>Down</em> direction, that is, away from the start point of the line. Normally this is the (largest) station closest to the coastline by rail; unlike on some other railways, every line is reset at the station from which it diverges. This is primarily due to the non-radial (i.e. pluricentric) nature of the Qevelian network. </p>
