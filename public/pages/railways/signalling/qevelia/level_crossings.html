			<h1>Level Crossings</h1>

			<p>There are a number of signs and signals that indicate the state of a level crossing to the driver. The vast majority of level crossings are protected by automatic warning devices (such equipment is mandated by law where the traffic exceeds a certain level) and trains normally have right-of-way. The somewhat unusual rules requiring trains to reduce speed before an insecured crossing are a relic of the manually-worked crossings which had gates that blocked the width of the railway when opened to vehicular traffic. Nowadays such crossings are found only on heritage lines. </p>


			<h2>Signals and Signs for Rail Vehicles</h2>

			<h3>Whistle Posts</h3>

			<p>Whistle posts are located at least 200 metres before a level crossing and mark the location where the driver must sound the whistle to give warning of the approach of the train. Driver must again sound the whistle when near the crossing. For lightly-used crossings without automatic protection equipment a whistle post will suffice; however speed is to be restricted to 120 km/h in such sections. </p>

			</div>

			<p />

			<h3>Level Crossing Approach signs</h3>

			<p>These signs are located at the start of the level crossing protection circuit. The length of the approach circuit is usually the distance travelled at the line reference speed in 30 seconds, or 600 metres, whichever is greater. New and upgraded level crossings, especially those on main lines with a variety of train speeds, are equipped with prediction circuits to ensure that the warning equipment operates for a fixed amount of time regardless of the speed of the approaching train. </p>

				</div>
			</div>

			<p>As the crossing prediction circuit begins here, trains must not accelerate until they pass a repeater acknowledging that the crossing is active and fully secured. </p>

			<h3>Level crossing repeater</h3>

			<p>This signal indicates the state of the level crossing ahead, and is usually located approximately halfway between the warning sign and the crossing itself, up to a minimum distance of 200 metres. The distance between the repeater and the crossing is that which a train travelling at the line reference speed will cover in about 15 seconds. The signal is approach-lit and remains dark until a train approaches the crossing. </p>

			<p>Whistle posts may or may not be provided adjacent to level crossing repeaters; driver must sound the whistle regardless. They are normally provided in locations where visibility of the line from the roadside is extremely limited. </p>

			<h3>Main Signals that protect crossings</h3>

			<p>Some locations have level crossings that intersect a station or siding with frequent shunting. In order to not delay road traffic unnecessarily, the crossing may be protected with a main or shunting signal. Such signals are indicated by a yellow post plate marked with a black X. </p>
