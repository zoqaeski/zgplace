			<h1>Level Crossings</h1>

			<p>There are a number of signs and signals that indicate the state of a level crossing to the driver. The vast majority of level crossings are protected by automatic warning devices (such equipment is mandated by law where the traffic exceeds a certain level) and trains normally have right-of-way. </p>


			<h2>Signals and Signs for Rail Vehicles</h2>

			<h3>Whistle Posts</h3>

			<p>Whistle posts are located at least 200 metres before a level crossing and mark the location where the driver must sound the whistle to give warning of the approach of the train. Driver must again sound the whistle when near the crossing. For lightly-used crossings without automatic protection equipment a whistle post will suffice; however speed is to be restricted to 120 km/h in such sections. </p>

				<h3>Level Crossing Approach signs</h3>

				<p>These signs are located at the start of the level crossing protection circuit. The length of the approach circuit is usually the distance travelled at the line maximum speed in 30 seconds, or 600 metres, whichever is greater. New and upgraded level crossings, especially those on main lines with a variety of train speeds, are equipped with prediction circuits to ensure that the warning equipment operates for a fixed amount of time regardless of the speed of the approaching train. </p>

					</div>
				</div>

				<p>As the crossing prediction circuit begins here, trains must not accelerate until they pass a repeater acknowledging that the crossing is active and fully secured. If no repeater is provided, trains must not accelerate until after the crossing. </p>

				<h3>Level crossing repeater</h3>

				<p>This signal indicates the state of the level crossing ahead, and is usually located approximately halfway between the warning sign and the crossing itself, up to a minimum distance of 200 metres. The distance between the repeater and the crossing is that which a train travelling at the line maximum speed will cover in about 15 seconds. </p>

				<h3>Home Signals that protect crossings</h3>

				<p>Some locations have level crossings that intersect a station or siding with frequent shunting. In order to not delay road traffic unnecessarily, the crossing may be protected with a home or shunting signal. Such signals are indicated by a yellow post plate marked with a black pictogram of a gate. </p>

				<h2>Level Crossing Sequence</h2>

				<p>The timing and operation sequence of level crossings depends on the type of road crossing (public or private) and the type of protection. Passive crossings are protected by signs and whistle posts, and are typically found only on lightly-trafficked lines or at private crossings. Private crossings must be secured shut with a manually operated gate that is to be opened only when required. Active crossings are protected by some combination of lights and half- or full- boom barriers. </p>

				<h3>Passive Crossings</h3>

				<p>Passive crossings have no barriers and are protected solely by signage. </p>

				<h3>Active Crossings without Boom Barriers</h3>

				<p>Active crossings without boom barriers operate for a minimum warning time of 18 seconds before the train arrives. The minimum time between consecutive operations is designed to be 18 seconds. </p>

				<h3>Half-Boom Barriers</h3>

				<p>The minimum warning time for half-boom barriers is 24 seconds, and the minimum time between consecutive operations of the barriers is designed to be 36 seconds. The time is based on the following: </p>

				<ul>
					<li>The warning lights operate for 6 seconds before the booms start to lower. </li>
					<li>The booms take 6 seconds to lower to the horizontal. </li>
					<li>The booms are down for 12 seconds prior to the arrival of the train. </li>
					<li>The booms take 6 seconds to raise once the up control has been initiated. </li>
					<li>The warning lights continue to operate until the booms have fully raised. </li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Full-Boom Barriers</h3>

				<p>The minimum warning time for full-boom barriers is 30 seconds, and the minimum time between consecutive operations of the barriers is designed to be 36 seconds. The time is based on the following: </p>

				<ul>
					<li>The warning lights operate for 6 seconds before the booms start to lower. </li>
					<li>The arrival booms take 6 seconds to lower to the horizontal. </li>
					<li>The departure booms commence lowering 4 seconds after the arrival booms have been detected down. </li>
					<li>The departure booms are down for 8 seconds prior to the arrival of the train. </li>
					<li>The arrival booms commence to rise after the departure booms have fully raised. </li>
					<li>The booms take 6 seconds to raise once the up control has been initiated. </li>
					<li>The warning lights continue to operate until all booms have fully raised. </li>
				</ul>
