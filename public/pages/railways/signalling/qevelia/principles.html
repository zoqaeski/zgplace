			<h1>Safeworking Principles</h1>
			<p>These pages give an in-depth guide to the signalling and safeworking principles of the Qevelian Railways. This page is something of an introduction, for those of you who don't understand some of the basics of railway signalling.</p>

			<h2>Methods of Block Working</h2>
			<p>Originally all lines were worked by a principle based on a token (commonly referred to as a <em>staff</em>). For each section of line, a number of staffs were allocated, and possession of one of these gave the driver assurance that there were no other conflicting movements within the block. The system would use the staff as a key, usually electrically linked, and only allow a new staff to be withdrawn if the total number of staffs were present at both ends.</p>
			<p>The key on the staff would also be used to unlock any turnouts within that section, and ensure that the line was set to its safe position - only when the points are physically back in their normal safe position can the key (and token) be removed from the lock.</p>
			<p>This system has been virtually replaced by automatic block working, a system that relies on track circuits to set the signals.</p>
