			<h1>Turnouts and Interlockings</h1>

			<p>There are a number of different types of turnout: </p>

			<ul>
				<li>Normal turnouts have a straight and diverging track. </li>
				<li>Curved turnouts have two tracks that curve in the same direction, one sharper than the other. </li>
				<li>‘Y’ turnouts have two tracks that curve in opposite directions. </li>
				<li>Slip turnouts are turnouts interlaced with diamond crossings in such a way as to allow vehicles to switch from one straight track to another. Double slips permit movement from either entry to either exit; single slips permit diverging movements from only one end. </li>
				<li>Other more unusual arrangements include interlaced turnouts, which allow more than two diverging routes, and curved variants of slips, but these are rare, due to their higher maintenance. </li>
			</ul>

			<p>To prevent the points from moving under the weight of a train, various locking mechanisms were devised to hold the point blades in position. The most common in use today is the clamp lock, in which the point blade is clamped to the stock rail. The mechanism is actuated by the same movement that operates the points. Less common is a separate locking device, normally referred to as a facing point lock; these usually require two levers to operate, one for the lock and one to move the points. </p>

			<h2>Turnout indicators</h2>

			<p>Turnouts are provided with indicators that display the setting for which the turnout is aligned. </p>

			<h3>Normal turnout indicators</h3>

			<p>Most turnouts are provided with an indicator that rotates 90° around a vertical axis. They are either retro-reflective or illuminated from the inside. Normal turnout indicators display the direction of the diverge from the facing end, and whether they are set for straight or diverging from the trailing end. Alternatively, the trailing end may also indicate the direction of the converge; in both cases the facing side has a white border. </p>

			<p>Curved turnouts in which both tracks curve in the same direction display the straight route for the lesser curved branch. ‘Y’ points, or turnouts with a curve in opposite directions, always display the direction for which the turnout is set, either the left or right; i.e. <em>both</em> directions are considered diverging moves. </p>

			<h3>Single- and Double- Slips</h3>

			<p>Single- and double- slip turnouts use a different type of indicator, with rotating vanes that cover translucent white panels in the indicator (or rotating white retro-reflective panels). Both sets of points at each end of a slip are connected such that they move in unison; two levers are required to select between the four routes. This arrangement is the most efficient method to operate such turnouts. </p>

			<h3>Turnout setting indicators</h3>

			<p>Lightly-used branch lines without signals may use large turnout setting indicators that are visible for a long distance. </p>

			<h2>Switch Weights</h2>

			<p>Mechanical locally-worked turnouts have switch weights, which are painted to indicate specific details: </p>
