			<h1>Cab Signalling</h1>

			<p>There are two cab signalling systems in use on the Qevelian railways. The older system uses beacons powered by magnetic induction that transmit the maximum speed to the train. This has been augmented with a newer system that can transmit more detailed information from cable loops mounted between the rails. </p>

			<p>Each of these systems are described in greater detail on their own page: </p>

				<dd>A newer system, developed for high-speed trains, that continuously transmits speed information to the trains. </dd>
