<h3>verbatim</h3>

<pre>
 \begin{verbatim}
   text 
 \end{verbatim}
</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre>
 \begin{verbatim*}
   text
 \end{verbatim*}
</pre>

<p>The <tt>verbatim</tt> environment is a paragraph-making environment that gets LaTeX to print exactly what you type in. It turns LaTeX into a typewriter with carriage returns and blanks having the same effect that they would on a typewriter.  The output looks exactly as it looks in the input file.</p>

<p>The difference between <tt>verbatim</tt> and <tt>verbatim*</tt> is that the latter prints spaces as "visual" spaces, i.e., a short, squat "u".</p>

<p>The only text which cannot be placed in the <tt>verbatim</tt>
environment is the 14-character sequence "\end{verbatim}".</p>

<p>The <tt>verbatim</tt> environment may <strong>not</strong> be used in the argument of another command. However, it <strong>can</strong> be placed inside a <a href="ltx-267.html">minipage environment</a> which allows you to manipulate its placement.</p>
