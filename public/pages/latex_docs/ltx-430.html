<h3>Dashes</h3>

<p>LaTeX provides for three sizes of dashes which are indicated
by typing one, two, or three consecutive dashes in the text.</p>

<ul>
  <li>a hyphenation dash, as in X-ray, is a single dash</li>
  <li>a dash between limits, as in 1--2, is a double dash</li>
  <li>a parenthetical punctuation --- such as this --- is a triple dash</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that this applies to paragraph mode. In math mode each
<tt>-</tt> is interpreted as a minus sign.</p>
