<h3>\line</h3>

<p><tt>\line(x-slope,y-slope){length}</tt></p>

<p>The <tt>\line</tt> command draws a line of the specified
length and slope.</p>

<p>The slope is determined by <tt>(x-slope,y-slope)</tt> which
are signed integers of magnitude less than or equal to 6 and
which have no common divisor except for plus or minus one; For
example (1,0) is a horizontal line; (1,1) gives a slope of 45
degress; (0,1) is a vertical line; (-1,1) is 135 degrees.

<p>The <strong>horizontal</strong> extent of the line is given
by the <tt>length</tt> parameter, except in the case of a
vertical line in which case <tt>length</tt> specifies the
vertical height.</p>
