			<h1>Syntax</h1>
			<h2>Word Order</h2>
			<p>Being a language with an active morphological case system, in Qevesa the word order is not as strict as English. It is basically <abbr title="Subject–Object–Verb">SOV</abbr>, however because Qevesa is a null-subject language (the subject does not have to be explicitly stated), the order of words in a sentence is driven by pragmatic rather than syntactical factors.</p>
			<p>A sentence consists of four parts: focus, topics, verb, and any additional information. All but the verb may be empty; the focus can contain only a single phrase whilst the other parts may contain multiple phrases.</p>
			<p>This can be illustrated using the English sentence "Peter took Julia two books this morning" as an example. Qevesa variations are shown below:</p>
			<table cellspacing="0" class="cl">
				<!--<colgroup span="6">
					<col width="15%" />
					<col width="10%" />
					<col width="10%" />
					<col width="10%" />
					<col width="20%" />
					<col width="35%" />
				</colgroup>-->
				<tr>
					<th>Focus</th>
					<th>Topics</th>
					<th>Verb</th>
					<th>Additional information</th>
					<th>Special Meaning</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Ø</td>
					<td>Kiavan etoi ňokoita Žulijas turisti kevtast</td>
					<td>voitutt.</td>
					<td>Ø</td>
					<td>"Peter took Julia two books this morning" (Normal word order, no special emphasis)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td class="strong">Etoi ňokoita</td>
					<td>Ø</td>
					<td>voitutt</td>
					<td>Kiavan turisti kevtast Žulijas.</td>
					<td>It was <strong>two books</strong> that Peter took Julia this morning.</td>

					<td class="strong">Turisti kevtast</td>
					<td>Ø</td>

					<td>Kiavan etoi ňokoita Žulijas.</td>

					<td class="strong">Voitutt</td>

				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The focus is the most important piece of information, and is usually spoken with some emphasis; topics are also main information that represent the main arguments of the sentence; and the additional information is everything else. When an argument is focussed, all other information (except for agent pronouns (i.e. in the ergative case) that are also marked on the verbs) is moved after the verb; when there is no focus, all arguments precede the verb. The normal word order of these other arguments is:</p>
			<p class="strong tc">Agent – Theme – Patient/Recipient – Place – Manner – Time</p>
			<p>This is usually maintained, although it is not necessary to do so (native speakers will understand perfectly well, it'll just sound a little odd).</p>
			<p>Grammatical voice is usually conveyed with this flexible word order.</p>
			<h3>Adpositional Word Order</h3>
			<p>Adpositional phrases are also rearranged according to focus and topic. The neutral word order is Place–Manner–Time, however any arrangement is possible, however this only occurs when a particular adpositional phrase is focused. This can be illustrated with the English sentence, "I went to the shops by car yesterday." Qevesa variations are shown below:</p>

			<p>Note that when the focus is on any of the adpositional phrases, the agent pronouns are not omitted.</p>

			<h2>Conjunctions</h2>
			<p>Conjunctions in Qevesa are best described using postfix notation — conjunctions <em>always</em> follow their arguments — because Qevesa is a strongly left-branching language. They are used as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>X tav Y tav eloikautër. <em>I like X and Y.</em></li>
				<li>X ol Y ol eloikautër. <em>I like X or Y.</em></li>
				<li>Nois X-NEG os Y eloikautër. <em>I don't like X but I like Y.</em></li>
				<li>Aini X ol Y eloikautër. <em>I like either X or Y.</em></li>
				<li>X osno Y-NEG eloikautër. <em>I like X but not Y.</em></li>
				<li>X-NEG nauru Y-NEG eloikautër. <em>I like neither X nor Y.</em></li>
				<li>X eloikautër, tav Y ësos. <em>I like X, and Y as well.</em></li>
				<li>X eloikautër, os Y ësos. <em>I like not only X, but Y as well.</em></li>
				<li>X porvutomër, ustul Y. <em>I have X, therefore I'll have Y.</em></li>
				<li>X eloikautër, tacëik Y. <em>I like X because of Y.</em></li>
				<li>X porvutomër, ustul Y porvutomër. <em>I'll have X so that I'll be able to have Y.</em></li>
				<li>X eloikautër, tessol Y gössottutt. <em>I like X even though Y is dreadful.</em></li>
				<li>X eloikautër, tessol Y sóttutt. <em>I like X, although Y is nice.</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Although all the examples above illustrate uses of the basic conjunctions with nominal arguments, conjunctions can be used in the same manner to link adjectives, verbs, phrases, and in fact entire clauses. The conjunctions above and a number of other logical connectors are summaried in the table below:</p>

			<h2>Clauses</h2>
			<p>The simplest cases are when two or more clauses are concatenated, each with different arguments. Simple conjunctions are used:</p>
			<dl class="gloss">
				<dt>Vykkaviki žyviautukšas ottukër, tav ëki sopra žerutukšas ottukk.</dt>
				<dd class="gl">bus-PL.GEN drive-VI-PPL-ACC be-PFV-1SG, and 1SG.GEN wife-DCHT law-VI-PPL-ACC be-PFTV</dd>
				<dd>I am a bus driver, and my wife is a lawyer.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>When two (or more) clauses share an argument, the additional verbs are simply added after one another, usually in the order that the events (would) occur:</p>
			<dl class="gloss">
				<dt>A maman meki teňelas veluott, tav zondött.</dt>
				<dd class="gl">the mother-ERG 3SG-GEN  baby-ACC lift-PFV, and comfort-PFV</dd>
				<dd>The mother picked up her baby and comforted it.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>If the arguments change, the new arguments are added after the initial one, also usually in the order that the events would occur:</p>
			<dl class="gloss">
				<dt>A maman meki teňelas zondött, tav a pyrökas kortutt tav.</dt>
				<dd class="gl">DEF mother-ERG 3SG.GEN baby-ACC comfort-PFV, and DEF cry-IPF-ACC stop-PFV</dd>
				<dd>The mother comforted her baby and the crying stopped.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>This tends to cause ambiguity, because from the arguments given there is no way to tell whose crying stopped. To avoid ambiguity, the baby may be explicitly mentioned:</p>
			<dl class="gloss">
				<dt>A maman meki teňelas zondött, tav a teňelëki pyrökas kortutt.</dt>
				<dd class="gl">DEF mother-ERG 3SG.GEN baby-ACC comfort-PFV-3SG, and DEF baby-GEN cry-IPF-ACC stop-PFV</dd>
				<dd>The mother comforted her baby and the baby's crying stopped.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>A better way of avoiding ambiguity would be to make the baby the focus and reference it using the focus suffix, <em>-kar</em>:</p>
			<dl class="gloss">
				<dt>Meki teňelas zondött a maman, tav pyrökas kortutkar.</dt>
				<dd class="gl">3SG.GEN baby-ACC DEF mother-ERG comfort-PFV, and cry-IPF-ACC stop-PFV-FOC</dd>
				<dd>The mother comforted her baby and it stopped crying.</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>This method of reference is most commonly used when a referent is introduced in one clause, typically as a patient, and focus on it in the next, typically as an agent, such as in relative clauses. In this case, an agent pronoun is not needed and thus normally omitted:</p>
			<dl class="gloss">
				<dt>Mas jan qelutër, a limmas kuoðukkar.</dt>
				<dd class="gl">3SG.ACC 1SG.ERG see-PFV-1SG, the milk-ACC drink-IPF-FOC</dd>
				<dd>I see him/her drinking milk. <em>(I see him/her, he/she is drinking milk.)</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p><em>Kar</em> can also be used as a pronoun when the arguments change case or are not sequential. It is inflected like a noun, using the appropriate suffixes:</p>
			<dl class="gloss">
				<dt>A vomis jan najatër, karas qelutër zeðokoitest.</dt>
				<dd class="gl">the man-ACC 1SG.ERG know-PFV-1SG, FOC-ACC see-PFV-1SG yesterday-ESS</dd>
				<dd>I know the man (whom) I saw yesterday. <em>(I know the man, I see him yesterday.)</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>There is no limit to the number of clauses that can be strung together (although after a while people will think you're droning on...):</p>
			<dl class="gloss">
				<dt>A vomis tan qelutar a kotað kösy, šemnisi luccenas ovësutkar, tapuotukša ottutkar, tav tapuoðokëð kösy lovužutkar.</dt>
				<dd class="gl">the man-ACC 2SG.ERG see-PFV-2SG the street-POS in, white-ACC coat-ACC wear-PFV-FOC, doctor-DCHT be-PFV-FOC, and hospital-POS in work-PVF-FOC</dd>
				<dd>The man in the white coat that you saw in the street is a doctor, and he works at the hospital. <em>(You see the man in the street, he wears white coat, he is a doctor and he works at the hospital.)</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p><em>Kar</em> is not the only way in which clauses can be linked. The other is the relative pronoun <em>duol</em>, which is used in a similar manner, although with the exception that it cannot act as a verb suffix for person. The big difference is that <em>kar</em> references the focus of the initial clause, whereas <em>duol</em> references the focus of the previous clause.</p>
			<dl class="gloss">
				<dt>A vomis jan kölnautër, ëki zibisan karas/duolas mëkuott.</dt>
				<dd class="gl">the man-ACC 1SG.ERG meet-PFV-1SG, sister-1SG.GEN-ERG 3SG.ACC-FOC love-PFV-3SG</dd>
				<dd>I met the man my sister loves. <em>(I met the man, my sister loves him.)</em></dd>

				<dt>A vomis jan kölnautër, ëki zibisan sennuott, «duolan karas mëkuott».</dt>
				<dd class="gl">the man-ACC 1SG.ERG meet-PFV-1SG, sister-1SG.GEN-ERG say-PVF-3SG, SFC-ERG 3SG.ACC-FOC love-PFV-3SG</dd>
				<dd>I met the man (that) my sister said she loved. <em>(I met the man, my sister says, "I love him.")</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>If <em>karan</em> was used instead of <em>duolan</em>, the above sentence would translate as <em>"I met the man whom my sister says loves himself."</em> This is in contrast with the first example, in which either could be used without altering the meaning. Note that using these to mark an object of another verb (which is basically what is being done above) is somewhat unusual; a more appropriate method is the the third relative construction. It used primarily when a verb takes a clause as its object, rather than when further clauses provide further descriptive information. The particles <em>kep-</em> and <em>cëp-</em> are very similar to relative pronouns as found in many other languages. Their use is illustrated below:</p>
			<dl class="gloss">
				<dt>A vomis jan kölnautër, ëki zibisan sennuott <em>kepas</em>, karas mëkuott.</dt>
				<dd class="gl">the man-ACC 1SG.ERG meet-PFV-1SG, sister-1SG.GEN-ERG say-PVF-3SG REL.ACC 3SG.ACC-FOC love-PFV-3SG</dd>
				<dd>I met the man (that) my sister said she loved. <em>(I met the man, my sister says that she loves him.)</em></dd>

				<dt>A vomis jan kölnautër, karas mëkuott, ëk zibisan sennuott <em>cëpas</em>.</dt>
				<dd class="gl">the man-ACC 1SG.ERG meet-PFV-1SG, 3SG.ACC-FOC love-PFV-3SG, sister-1SG.GEN-ERG say-PVF-3SG REL.ACC</dd>
				<dd>I met the man (that) my sister said she loved. <em>(I met the man, she loves him, my sister says [that].)</em><br /><span class="small">(This doesn't sound quite right in English but works fine in Qevesa.)</span></dd>
			</dl>
			<p><em>Kep-</em> references the clause which is to act as an object when it follows its referee; <em>cëp-</em> references the clause that precedes its referee.</p>
			<!--<p>Usually the threshold is three clauses strung together:</p>
			<dl class="gloss">
				<dt>Turisi tamós tasnaut ziblilokëan, Kiava autmir.</dt>
				<dd class="gl">this house-ACC build-PFV-3SG brother-1SG.GEN-ERG, that Peter-DCHT be-PFV-3SG</dd>
				<dd>This is the house that my brother Peter built. <em>(This house my brother that is Peter built.)</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>Note that the relative pronoun may not always reference the focussed argument. Using the above example, if the emphasis was on Peter, the sentence would be rearranged as follows:</p>
			<dl class="gloss">
				<dt>Ziblilokëan tasnaut turisi tamós, Kiava autkar.</dt>
				<dd class="gl">brother-1SG.GEN-ERG build-PFV-3SG this house-ACC, that Peter-DCHT be-PFV-3SG</dd>
				<dd>My brother Peter built this house. <em>(This house my brother that is Peter built.)</em></dd>
			</dl>
			<p>There is no need for the relative pronoun in this case as the brother is focussed and referenced using the focus particle/suffix.</p>
			<h3>Difference between <em>duo</em> and <em>-kar</em></h3>
			<p>From the above sections it can be seen that there are two main methods of constructing clauses, the suffix <em>-kar</em> and the pronoun/particle <em>duo</em>. Although they perform similar functions, there is a fundamental difference in what they refer to: <em>duo</em> refers to the focus of the last clause; and <em>-kar</em> refers to the focus of the first clause. This is illustrated in the following examples:</p>
			<dl class="gloss">
				<dt>Turisi tamós tasnaut ziblilokëan, Kiava aut.</dt>
				<dd class="gl">this house-ACC build-PFV-3SG brother-1SG.GEN-ERG, that Peter-DCHT be-PFV-3SG</dd>
				<dd>This is the house that my brother Peter built. <em>(This house my brother that is Peter built.)</em></dd>
			</dl>-->
			<h2>Questions</h2>
			<p>A sentence is turned into a question with the particle <em>svo</em>. It immediately follows the verb.</p>
			<dl class="gloss">
				<dt>Turlotoisi vomis a katað kösy qelutar.</dt>
				<dd class="gl">DEF man-ACC DEF street.POS in see-PFV-2SG</dd>
				<dd>You see that man in the street.</dd>
				<dt>Turlotoisi vomis a katað kösy qelutar svo?</dt>
				<dd class="gl">DEF man-ACC DEF street.POS in see-PFV-2SG Q</dd>
				<dd>Did you see that man in the street?</dd>
			</dl>
			<h3>Yes/No Questions</h3>
			<p>Yes/no questions are also expressed with this particle. A short positive answer is often given by repeating the verb, instead of using the word <em>Šyky</em> ("Yes").</p>
			<ul class="nobullet">
				<li><em>Ävtösösmir svo? – Šyky ävtösöss.</em> ("Has he left?" – "Yes, he has.")</li>
				<li><em>A žebykyttöita qeluttar svo? – Šyky qelutër.</em> ("Did you see the movie?" – "I saw.")</li>
			</ul>
			<p>A negative answer often consists of the verb in negative form:</p>
			<ul class="nobullet">
				<li class="em">Ävtösösmir svo?</li>
				<li><em>Niširo ävtösoss.</em> ("Has not left.") / <em>Niširo ävtösott.</em> ("Did not leave.")</li>
			</ul>
