<h2><a name="intro">1. Introduction and History</a></h2>

SNCF signaling on high density lines is based on automatic block and
interlocking signals (BAL - block automatique lumineux permissif).
Low density lines are signaled with separate home and distant
automatic (BAPR - block automatique à permissivit'e restreinte) or
manual (BM - block manuel) signals.
<p>
Block signals provide up to 6 track occupancy aspects, and provide
indications for 3 speeds in the main signal head.  Additional speeds
are signaled by supplementary heads, as are directional indications.
</p><p>
French railways have an extremely diverse history of mechanical
signals.  These most often consisted of boards which rotated between
presentation face-forward and edge-on.  The night aspects were
provided by spectacles in the face of the boards turning a lamp the
proper color.  When the signal rotated to edge-on, the white light was
visible for the clear indication.  Semaphores were also occasionally
used for mechanical signals, notably for a permissive stop indication,
and in stacks for route indication.  In an attempt to standardise the
signal aspects and indications, the French government produced a "Code
des Signaux" in 1885, which resulted in standardisation of the most
common signals, but each railroad still used some unique signaling.
Later the lamps were moved below the signal board to form assemblies
of colorlights which corresponded to more than one mechanical board
when installed in clusters.
</p><p>
In the early 1930's, colorlight signals were experimented with,
originally corresponding to the 1885 code and other individual
railroad practise.
</p><p>
The SNCF predecessor railroads merged in 1938 (with previous mergers shown
in parenthesis):
</p><pre>        AL         Alsace-Lorraine
        Est        Eastern
        PLM        Paris-Lyon-M'editerran'ee
        Nord       Northern
        Etat       State ----+--(1909)-- ETAT
        Ouest      Western --+
        PO         Paris-Orl'eans --+
        Midi       Southern --------+--(1934)-- PO-Midi
</pre>
In 1930 it was decided to reform the French signal code to eliminate
the white clear aspect to be replaced by green, and to use yellow for
caution instead of green.  This corresponded with the general change
from white/green/red to green/yellow/red throughout the world, due to
the dangers associated with a white clear.  The color changes
consisted both of the color of boards for day aspects as well as the
color of lights for night aspects.  This change in the French signal
code is commonly referred to as Verlant, after M. Verlant, traffic
superintendent of the PLM who presided over the committee of the 
various railroads which recommended the changes to the French
Minister of Public Works.
<p>
The first phase, completed in 1935, was to replace the use of yellow
in stop signals by violet.  These were yard signals, and the white
clear was then changed to lunar white.  Yellow was then added to the
disque (deferred stop), and the green removed from the semaphore stop
indication.  Approach and speed reduction indications were then
changed from green to yellow, and finally, clear indications from
white to green.
</p><p>
A few early colorlight installations were based on a design for the
1885 code, and had to be completely changed.  Some installations
anticipated the change, and consisted of two heads mounted
side-by-side, providing the 2-light 1885 indications.  When the change
was made to the new code, one of the heads was removed, and the colors
of the lenses were changed from white/green to green/yellow.
</p><p>
The new signal code was refined slightly in 1941, and is the basis for
modern signal practice.  Originally, a small lunar white modifier
(oeilleton) was added to block and interlocking signals as a call-on
indication for a permissive stop and proceed to be used with a
semaphore (single red).  Later, these were removed from block signals,
and are now installed only on interlocking signals so that a red lamp
failure (one of two in a carr'e absolute stop indication) will still
indicate absolute stop.  As speeds increased, additional aspects were
added in the form of flashing lights, as were explicit speed signals.
Mechanical signals have largely disappeared from the SNCF, but 1941
code signals can still occasionally be seen.
