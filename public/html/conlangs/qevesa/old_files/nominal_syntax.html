			<!--<h2>Articles</h2>
			<h3>The Definite Article</h3>
			<p>The defintite article is used more frequently in Qevesa than in English. It is used:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Before nouns used in an abstract or a general sense:<br />
					e.g. <em>As oromavas eloikautër</em> – I like horses (lit. I like the horses).<br />
					e.g. <em>A laikavas takautivmir toisti erest</em> – Fish is expensive this year (lit. The fish is expensive this year).</li>
				<li>Before each noun in a collection or series of nouns.<br />
					e.g. <em></em></li>
					Ήρtαν τα βιβλία, τα περιοδικά και οι εφημερίδες που ζήτησα; - have the books, magazines and newspapers I asked for arrived? (lit. have the books, the magazines and the newspapers I asked for arrived yet?)
				<li>Before expressions of measure and weight.<br />
					e.g. <em></em></li>
					Το τυρί κοστίζει πέντε ευρώ το κιλό - the cheese costs five euros a kilo (lit. the cheese costs five euros the kilo).
			</ul>
			<h3>The Indefinite Article</h3>
			<p>Strictly speaking, there is no indefinite article in Qevesa; the numeral <em>one</em> is used instead. Consequently, it is not used as often as its English counterpart, as it specifically expresses the concept of "one". One unusual use of the indefinite article is to negate nouns. Unlike the definite article, the indefinite article agrees in case with the noun it modifies.</p>-->
