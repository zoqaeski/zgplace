<H1 LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western">Qeveli Culture: Government</H1>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western">The Republic of Qevelia (<I>Qeveleqo
Kiruba</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">) has a totally different
style of government compared to most terrestrial countries. The
closest equivalent is </SPAN><I>democratic socialism</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">,
in which the democracy part is in fact a </SPAN><I>pure democracy</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">,
where every citizen is entitled to have a say in the running of
things.</SPAN></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="font-style: normal">Some would
say that Qevelia suffers from referendum disease of epidemic
proportions, however they fail to take into account the scale of
control that the people as a whole have over the running of their
country.</P>
<H2 LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western">National Divisions</H2>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western">The country is divided into 8
provinces (<I>siepadriva</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">)</SPAN>,
each roughly representing geographical regions. Each of these
provinces is then divided into local government areas (<I>valiva</I>),
each representing a town or city.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western">Every division of the state is run by
a council of twelve, the <I>toręa</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">,
of which one member is elected as an administrator by the populace of
the division. There is no head of state, but a council of eight
(</SPAN><I>yeřpa</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">) jointly run
the country.</SPAN></P>
<H2 LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western">Voting and Decisions</H2>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western">The administrators of each <I>valai</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
congregate in the capital city of the province to discuss the issues
that affect their </SPAN><I>vala</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">,
and also coordinate the voting and decision making.</SPAN></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western">For every decision that is to be made
by any division of the country the whole adult population affected by
that decision must vote on the issue. The results of these votes are
counted, and the majority in all levels is acted upon. The whole
population is encouraged to take a part in the running of the
country, and as such they may suggest ideas and proposals to their
local administrators; in fact, once a year (around the budget time) a
proposal sheet is sent to every voter, asking them to submit their
ideas.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western">This collection of ideas is then sent
up through the various levels, and roughly consistent trends are
discussed by the various administrators to determine possible new
policies. When finalised, they are voted upon by the public.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western">Every four years (offset by two
years), a new administrator for each province and each <I>valiva</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
are chosen through a vote.</SPAN></P>
<H2 LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western">Role of the Government</H2>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western">The government, as such, is merely an
administrative committee that sets down the laws, regulates the
money, and so on, according to the peoples' choices as shown through
the results of votes. A separate body, the <I>stola</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">,
acts as an ombudsman to weed out corruption; in the case of such
corruption being found, all concerned parties will be dissolved and
votes re-held in the appropriate areas. This is required by the
constitution, which was originally written to make the country a fair
place.</SPAN></P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="font-style: normal">All
nationwide infrastructure is owned and regulated by the government;
service providers are required by constitutional law to make
providing a service their highest priority. An example of this is
that the railway tracks are owned by the government, yet <I>Qeveliqo
Viažkoa</I> (Qevelian Railways) is a publicly owned company. The
limits on what services are provided are set by the government, which
in turn is totally decided by the citizens of Qevelia.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="font-style: normal">The
constitution states that all citizens of the country must have access
to education, health care, social security, and other related
services. These are paid for by the relatively high taxes, which are
proportionally scaled so that the more one earns, the more one pays. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="font-style: normal">Other
important services, whilst not in the same bracket as those mentioned
in the previous paragraph, such as water, power, telecommunications,
and the like, are supplied to all households at a basic rate. This
basic rate, whilst usable, is minimal and if more is wanted then
extra is paid for the particular service.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="font-style: normal">The
economy is not controlled by the government, instead the government
regulates the laws pertaining to the businesses to ensure that the
ordinary people don't lose out in the long run. For example, the
government does not tell the factories how much consumer goods must
be produced, however it enforces how the workers must be treated, how
the environment must be protected, and so on. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="font-style: normal">Wages are
determined by a national wage index, which allocates payments to
workers based on duration of work, difficulty of work, and
contribution to society as a whole. Difficulty of work is determined
by a number of factors, including physical work, workload, and so on.
An occupation with a large amount of manual labour will get paid more
than an equivalent occupation without the manual labour, for example.
The <I>contribution to society as a whole</I> clause is put in to
ensure that teachers, doctors and other related professions get paid
a slightly higher rate.</P>
<P LANG="en-GB" CLASS="western" STYLE="font-style: normal">This
national wage index, like everything else in the country, is amended
by votes of the people.</P>
