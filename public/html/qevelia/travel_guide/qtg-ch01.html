			<h1>The Land and Climate</h1>
			<p>Qevelia is divided into 8 provinces, which roughly correspond to the geographical regions. The provinces consist of:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Kirua</em>, the broad valley of the Plåkea river, including the capital, also called Kirua.</li>
				<li><em>Sijou</em>, the northernmost province, centred around the Miöřpa river.</li>
				<li><em>Aléká</em> is the centrally located province, mostly consisting of the Viqelo river valley and its tributaries.</li>
				<li><em>Tevsia</em>, like the other provinces, also basically consists of a river valley (the Škvita river), however it has the longest coastline of all the provinces and is only mountainous north- and south east.</li>
				<li><em>Lyeþal</em> is the province occupying the south west corner of Qevelia. It also has a relatively long coastline, and possesses the largest fjord on the whole continent, <em>Rovál</em>.</li>
				<li><em>Čomvo</em> is the province in the far north east. It is the largest province, and is mostly mountainous in the west and relatively flat in the east. It is also the most sparsely populated, and the furthest from Kirua by any land transport mode. Qevelia's highest mountain, <em>Aperu</em>, is located in the south west corner of Čomvo.</li>
				<li><em>Yukayi</em> is Qevelia's only land-locked province, in that it is the only one that does not share a border with a national border. It is also the most mountainous and the highest in that it does not have any land below 300 metres.</li>
				<li><em>Molura</em> is located in the south east corner of Qevelia, and is mostly mountainous, with a huge tract of <em>luiso</em> plains towards the east.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In non political terms, the country consists of the coastal plains and low undulating country to the west, broken by high ranges protruding from the central Oteqa Mountains. East of the mountains lie the <em>luiso</em> plains, a huge, relatively flat steppe that averages about 200 metres above sea level.</p>
			<p>The west is mostly covered in coniferous forest, broken by lines of civilisation. The further east one goes, the more open the landscape becomes. The Oteqa mountains are fairly barren in the higher altitudes, with only hardy long grasses being found towards the summits. The fast east, in the rain shadow of the mountains, is fairly dry with grasses, mosses and small shrubs being the only vegetation.</p>
			<h2>Climate and Weather</h2>
			<p>Qevelia is fairly cool year round, with warm summers in the south east. The northern provinces are generally cooler, and the western half of the country is quite wet, with regular rain. The east, by comparison, is often dry, and in winter is bitterly cold due to the winds rushing off the mountains.</p><p>There is semi permanent snow above 2000 metres or so, however in winter it is not unusual for snow to fall quite heavily even on the coast.</p>
			<p>During the summers, late afternoon thunderstorms are common. The warm air from the ocean meets the freezing cold air near the mountains, and this often causes quite exciting weather, with some spectacular displays of lightning inland.</p>
			<p>During winter, on the southern coast, it is not uncommon for very thick fogs to roll in overnight. These fogs often limit visibility to less than 100 metres, and transportation will usually experience delays, especially air and road.</p>
