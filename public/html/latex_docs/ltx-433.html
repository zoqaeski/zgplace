<h3>Quotation Marks</h3>

<p>LaTeX distinguishes between left (<tt>`</tt>) and right
(<tt>'</tt>) quotation marks; the former corresponds to the
"grave" generally found to the left of the numbers at top of the
keyboard, and the latter corresponds to the usual single quote
mark.</p>

<p>These symbols, by themselves, produce left and right single
quotes.</p>

<p>Double quote are produced by typing two in a row:
<tt>``text''</tt>.</p>

<p>To separate consecutive single and double quotes, use a
<tt><a href="ltx-185.html">\,</a></tt>.</p>
