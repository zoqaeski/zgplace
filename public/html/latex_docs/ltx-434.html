<h3>Comments in file</h3>

<p>You can insert comments into the LaTeX input (*.tex) file.
Anything following a percent sign (<tt>%</tt>) until the end of
the line is ignored by the LaTeX processor. </p>

<p>In fact, the <tt>%</tt> ends a line without generating a
space; an end-of-line in LaTeX input is normally equivalent to a
space. Thus, for example, it allows one to split a word over
lines without inserting a break. For example:</p>

<pre>
    this is an extra%
    ordinarily long word
</pre>

<p>would produce "this is an extraordinarily long word" with no
breaks. However, a <strong>command</strong> cannot be split
over lines this way.</p>
