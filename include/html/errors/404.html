			<h1>I have terrible news...</h1>
			<p>I think you should probably sit down for this. I don’t know how to break this to you, so I’m just going to go ahead and say it: that page you were looking for... it could not be found. I am terribly sorry.</p>
			<h2>This is probably because of the following:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>I lost the page.</li>
				<li>I <strong>never realised</strong> that the page was rubbish — it was <strong>accidentally deleted</strong> in an <strong>unavoidable</strong> attack of <strong>idiocy</strong> (the one which I am currently suffering from, which started several weeks before birth).</li>
				<li>This page was deleted by one of my monkey henchmen, in which case I will find him and make him listen to several hours of some really horrible music I have.</li>
				<li>I pressed the <strong>big red button which always does nasty things</strong> (why are the buttons you’re not supposed to touch always large and conspicuous?)</li>
				<li>The page <strong>never existed</strong> in the first place.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Suggested course of action <em>you</em> should take:</h2>
			<p>I strongly recommend that you <a href="javascript: history.back()">return to where you were a few moments ago</a> and work out what to do from there.</p>
